![The Brooks Review](http://d.pr/i/1hY1Q+ "Ben Brooks has it all wrong.")

I discovered [Ben Brooks](http://twitter.com/benjaminbrooks) a few weeks ago, when I saw a retweet in my timeline containing a [picture](https://twitter.com/BenjaminBrooks/status/629299867584753665) of his [E39 M5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M5#E39_M5_.281998.E2.80.932003.29). As per my usual, I checked out his [website](https://brooksreview.net) immediately thereafter. After exploring for a few minutes, I concluded that "this guy must be legit, because he has impeccable taste in both cars and website design."

I checked out his [Archive](https://brooksreview.net/archive) and found: 1) He has extensively reviewed [popular blogging software](https://brooksreview.net/2013/04/ulysses-iii/); 2) He has written a lot about *blogging* [in and of itself](https://brooksreview.net/2013/05/designing-blogs-for-readers/); and 3) He always seems to have a new [bag](https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/daylight-backpack/) to review (with nice pictures to boot). Apparently, this November hasn't been a departure from the caliber of his non-[NaNoWriMo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month) writing---there's just a lot more of it!

# The Ben Brooks Dilemma

His recent piece, [Living with a 12” Screen](https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/twelve/), struck a chord with me because I've been stuck between the same rock and a hard place as he. That is: **how do I reconcile my need/want/desire for a big-screen'd desk space with the reality that I do much of my best work on a small laptop?**

Unfortunately---and this is simply my opinion---Brooks simply settled on a MacBook, eschewing a big display altogether:
>I’ve spent a lot of time over my life trying to figure out what type of machine is best for everyone. Surely there has to be an answer to this, but honestly there isn’t.

>The more I think about it, the more I think you are either a big screen or small screen fan. You either value portability or you value screen real estate.

Dear Ben: does it have to be one or the other? Can't you have your cake and eat it, too?

If it isn't yet completely clear, know this: I mean no disrespect toward Ben Brooks. It's just that I might have a solution for him. Just like Brooks, I spent the better part of 2015 thinking about this big screen / little screen problem.

And after months of wondering, I think I've finally settled on the best hardware combination for me, for right now (more on the future later). And I think it could work for Brooks, too.

First, some history.

# It's Always Been a Laptop For me [yup]

Since my freshmen year of high school, my primary computing device has been a laptop computer. Because of that, the concept of "using a computer" has always involved using some sort of screen with an attached keyboard, packaged into a collapsable and backpack-able rectangular solid that I can easily take with me. 

That's not to say that a desktop computer is unfamiliar to me. Like any other normal person, I've been placed in situations when the only option afforded to me is a big screen with detached keyboard and mice peripherals. And I use them.

Using a desktop isn't a terrible experience, but it doesn't work for me 100% of the time. Sometimes---for many years, actually---I'd sit in a large sofa chair and type away on my MacBook. Sometimes a desk feels so constrained to me.

That's why I bought the Retina MacBook as soon as I could. 

But before that, I took a detour into desktop land, sort of.

# Desktop Land, Sort Of

Even though I was always a laptop kind of guy, I was curious. Could I could get any use out of a desktop computer?

There were times over the years when I could have definitely benefited from a desktop computer. Back when I was remuxing `.mkv`'s into iTunes-loving formats like `.m4v`, I could have used a quad core iMac or Mac Pro. Or <s>if</s> when I ever get around to [transcoding](http://www.imore.com/vector-22-don-melton-transcoding-video) a few non-iTunes movies ala [Don Melton](https://twitter.com/donmelton)---I could certainly use the processing power there too.

But a desktop machine isn't *just* about the raw processing power increase compared to a laptop. It's also about the screen.

So I had this idea: why not try out a Thunderbolt Display while I was waiting for the Retina MacBook to be released?

My [Thunderbolt Display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display) was my first true big-screen experience, one that I purchased used almost a year ago. To go from 11 inches to 27 inches was *not* a trivial thing. It was a big deal.

And it was eye-opening.

<div class="takehome">

"Oh, so that's what it's like to have a big screen."

</div>

Sure, the standard "best when bigger" apps apply: iTunes was better bigger, and Sketch was actually usable when blown up on the big screen. Even Safari was better bigger: it meant I could use the Web Inspector without losing half the viewport width to development panes!

# My Current Setup

My setup was *then* almost exactly what it is now, except that an 11" MacBook Air and a Thunderbolt Display.

I had the 11" MacBook Air because the 2015 Retina MacBook had not yet been announced/released. It was a slow computer, for sure. But nothing was/is as slow as that Retina MacBook. I "suffered" for 6 months with that machine.

Okay, I wasn't truly suffering. The Retina MacBook was a joy to admire and to handle. Right now I'm typing on a 13" MacBook Pro with Retina Display, and I miss everything about the Retina MacBook's hardware. The case was impossibly light, the display was noticeably better than my current MacBook Pro, and the keyboard was a lot less sloppy. 

Yes, I know many have lauded the Retina MacBook's unconventional keyboard mechanisms. But I loved it. It felt precise. I've never been a real button masher, so I didn't miss the rather bouncy key travel of every other previous MacBook keyboard.

But the speed. Oh the speed! The speed was ... absolutely terrible. The Retina MacBook is the only computer I've ever had that stuttered and dropped frames with the Netflix web app. (Even the MacBook Air handled that simple task flawlessly.) It felt quick enough for 75% of the tasks I threw at it, but that last 25% always left me hanging.

It was this lack of CPU prowess that pushed me to sell that, and get the 13" MacBook Pro that I currently use.

# Looking to the Future

I don't anticipate my 13" MacBook Pro with Retina Display being a part of my computer setup for a long time. Indeed, as soon as Apple updates the MacBook Pro lineup with the same hardware amenities adorning the Retina MacBook, this 13" is out the door.

The same can be said of the Thunderbolt Display. Yes, it's nice to have a big screen, but this big screen was released in 2011---well before Retina made the jump from the iPhone to the MacBook (and years before any desktop Mac had a Retina display). Because of that, much of the technology affordances on the Thunderbolt Display are decidedly old-school.

USB 3.0? Yeah right! (This thing has USB *2.0* ports.)

Thunderbolt 2? Yeah right! (Thunderbolt 1, only.)

Retina 5K? Yeah right! (This is basically 2.5K.)

Get close enough, and you can appreciate the *significant* air gap between the display and the cover glass. (Ugh.)

The speakers, despite having a larger aperture than the more modern iMac's, don't sound all that great.

Yes, you get it: there's a lot to complain about.

But there's also a lot to praise.

Do you want a docking station for a MacBook? This thing---some 4 years after its release---is still your best bet.

The Gigabit Ethernet and non-terrible USB hub aren't terrible either.

As much as I'm looking forward to the eventual (?) update to the Thunderbolt Display, I'm happy to use this for as long as I can.

# The Ben Brooks Dilemma: Solved (For Me)

Over the course of 9 months, I've been through three laptop Mac's and two external displays. I've settled (for the time being) on a 13" MacBook Pro and a Thunderbolt Display.

This is the best setup for me.

And it might just work for you too (even if it doesn't for Ben Brooks).
