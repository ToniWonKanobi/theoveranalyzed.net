Ever since I started working, the iTunes Store has been my goto for digital media. I made a promise to myself that once I was making money instead of borrowing it from the government, I would make a genuine effort to quit torrenting/downloading digital media and start paying for it. In a moment of self-righteous fervor several months ago, I deleted my entire iTunes movie library (~200 movies) and actually purchased what I considered the most important titles.[^money] Even [Don Melton](http://twitter.com/donmelton)---the guy whose [Handbrake-powered scripts](https://github.com/donmelton/video-transcoding-scripts) have become the *de facto* standard for transcoding hard copy content to digital---even he would [agree](https://github.com/donmelton/video-transcoding-scripts#alternatives-to-transcoding-your-media) that sourcing digital media through iTunes is probably the easiest way to obtain digital media:

<blockquote>

Before using transcode-video.sh or any manual transcoding system, consider these four alternatives:

1. Buy or rent videos from online services like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. Check "[Can I Stream.It?](http://www.canistream.it/)" to see if what you want to watch is available.
	* Upside: Often cheaper than buying physical media like Blu-ray Discs and DVDs.
	* Upside: Much easier to store and catalog than physical media.
	* Upside: Usually playable on mobile devices.

</blockquote>

Still, there are times when the content I want is simply not on the iTunes Store. Or, other times, the version of whatever I want is not on the iTunes Store. I can think of no better example

[^money]: Once I started actually paying for movies, I had to think twice when contemplating a new addition to my collection. When I was pirating movies, I wouldn't hesitate to download even the most terrible B-movie, just to have it. But some of those B-movies cost $20 on the iTunes Store. While twenty bucks isn't exactly a large sum of money, it's certainly not chump change either---twenty dollars is a long way towards a meal out to eat with Allison. (And I love going out to eat [üç¥](https://instagram.com/p/1ExLghwz2f/?taken-by=toniwonkanobi))
