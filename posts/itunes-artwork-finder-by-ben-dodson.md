Ever since I [started working](http://twitter.com/anthonycraigdds), the iTunes Store has been my goto for digital media. I made a promise to myself that once I was making money instead of [borrowing it from the government](http://www.myfedloan.org/), I would make a genuine effort to quit [torrenting](https://www.transmissionbt.com/)/downloading digital media and start paying for it. 

In a moment of self-righteous fervor several months ago, I purged <s>all</s>most all[^well] of the pirated content in my iTunes library (~200 movies, ~20 TV series, and lots of albums) and <s>re</s>purchased what I considered my must-have [titles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/goodfellas/id275463151?at=1l3vx9s).[^money] Even [Don Melton](http://twitter.com/donmelton)---the guy whose [Handbrake-powered scripts](https://github.com/donmelton/video-transcoding-scripts) have become the *de facto* standard for transcoding hard copy content to digital---even he would [agree](https://github.com/donmelton/video-transcoding-scripts#alternatives-to-transcoding-your-media) that sourcing digital media through iTunes is probably the easiest way to obtain digital media:

<blockquote>

Before using transcode-video.sh or any manual transcoding system, consider these four alternatives:

1. Buy or rent videos from online services like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. Check "[Can I Stream.It?](http://www.canistream.it/)" to see if what you want to watch is available.
	* Upside: Often cheaper than buying physical media like Blu-ray Discs and DVDs.
	* Upside: Much easier to store and catalog than physical media.
	* Upside: Usually playable on mobile devices.

</blockquote>

Still, there are times when the content I want is simply not on the iTunes Store. Or, other times, the version of whatever I wanted was not on the iTunes Store. I can think of no better example

[^money]: Once I started actually paying for movies, I had to think twice when contemplating a new addition to my collection. When I was pirating movies, I wouldn't hesitate to download even the most terrible B-movie, just to have it. But [some of those](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-fugitive/id282551004?at=1l3vx9s) B-movies cost $15 on the iTunes Store. While fifteen bucks isn't exactly a large sum of money, it's certainly not chump change either---it's a long way towards a meal out to eat with Allison! (And I love going out to eat [üç¥](https://instagram.com/p/1ExLghwz2f/?taken-by=toniwonkanobi))
[^well]: In doing so, I also morally reconciled myself with keeping a few pirated medias. For instance, some iTunes versions of the media I wanted was less than desirable. So what did I do? I bought the less than desirable versions, deleted them, and [pirated the version I wanted](http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/2015/5/14/this-is-the-best-version-of-star-wars-and-watching-it-is-a-crime). I feel okay with that.
