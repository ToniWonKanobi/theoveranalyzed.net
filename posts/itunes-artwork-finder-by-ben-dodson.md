Ever since I started working, my go-to for digital media has been iTunes. Even [Don Melton](http://twitter.com/donmelton)---the guy whose [Handbrake-powered scripts](https://github.com/donmelton/video-transcoding-scripts) have become the *de facto* standard for transcoding hard copy content to digital---even he would [agree](https://github.com/donmelton/video-transcoding-scripts#alternatives-to-transcoding-your-media) that sourcing digital media through iTunes is probably the easiest way to obtain digital media:

Before using transcode-video.sh or any manual transcoding system, consider these four alternatives:

1. Buy or rent videos from online services like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. Check "[Can I Stream.It?](http://www.canistream.it/)" to see if what you want to watch is available.

	* Upside: Much easier to store and catalog than physical media.
	* Upside: Usually playable on mobile devices.
