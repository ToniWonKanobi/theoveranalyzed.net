@@ Title=The Newsletter  

## Why a Newsletter?

While nerdy folk follow the site via [Twitter][twitter] or via [RSS][rss], most of my family and friends are not that nerdy. To accommodate their non-nerdy tendencies, I created a [MailChimp][mailchimp] newsletter powered by the site's RSS feed. 

## How It Works

Every day, the MailChimp servers detect whether I've posted anything new since the previous day. If so, MailChimp generates a new email to subscribers containing all of the posts published since the last newsletter went out.

## History

I have struggled with offering email subscriptions since founding TheOverAnalyzed in 2014. Originally, I was all for it, since I figured it would be better to include rather than exclude non-nerdy people by default. However, my plans were thwarted when I realized that, at least [according to MailChimp][mailchimp 2], my email campaign would be subject to the [US CAN-SPAM Act][business]. In a nutshell, this would have required me to include my actual home address in the footer of the emails (since TheOverAnalyzed is not a business with its own business address). That was something I was just not comfortable with.

## So

So what's changed? Nothing, really. I still don't plan to use my actual address in the bodies of MailChimp's emails. I have just come to the realization that I simply don't care enough about MailChimp's blind subscription to and application of the US CAN-SPAM Act. The Act was meant to curb spammers who so often mask nefarious intentions with tons of misleading text and flashy HTML graphics. That's not what I'm trying to do. I'm not selling anything. My blog is just for my rants, and sharing other people's rants. If that doesn't jive with MailChimp, whatever. Come at me MailChimp: **I dare you**.

## Linked Posts

Since [moving][move] to Casey Liss's Camel, I have a built-in 'permalink RSS feed' of sorts. The [alternate RSS][rssa] feed has linked entries pointing back to my site (in lieu of their targets). This was a great basis for the newsletter feed, since the same people put off by Twitter and RSS are probably the same people put off by the idea of a [Linked List][ll].
