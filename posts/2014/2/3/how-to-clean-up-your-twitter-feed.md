Eric Ravenscraft for Lifehacker:
>Twitter is a serious communications medium with a really silly name. Regardless of the vernacular, Twitter can actually be really useful for getting up-to-the-minute information. Assuming, of course, you know how to get just the good stuff and filter out the junk.

Agreed. This is a great article that talks about how to keep your Twitter feed under control. I remember when I first started using Twitter heavily, I would unlock my phone at the end of the school day with close to 300 tweets waiting for me! Talk about the [fire hydrant][gigaom].

I now have settled on several [lists][twitter], which help keep some of the extraneous noise out of my feed. I have also reverted to explicitly not following or listing everyone and everything I like. [The Dodo][thedodo], for instance, is a great resource for animal lovers and vegans alike, but they [tweet][twitter 2] upwards of 50 posts a day! So I stopped following them, and instead just view their site in Desktop Safari when I get home. 

[HSUS][humanesociety] covers most of the same stuff, and they are more conservative when it comes to posting on [Twitter][twitter 3].

So check out this article and get ready for sub-200 number of tweets waiting for you at the end of the day!
