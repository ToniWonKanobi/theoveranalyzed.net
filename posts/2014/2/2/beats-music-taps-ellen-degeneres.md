I have been using the new [Beats Music][apple] app for about a week. It had some [troubles initially][digitaltrends] at launch but overall it takes an interesting [turn away from the status quo][macstories] that is [Spotify][spotify] and [Rdio][rdio]. 

The app itself is actually very good at knowing what I want to listen to---something Spotify absolutely sucks at, and something Rdio cannot do consistently. The whole "[Sentence][sbnation]" UI is innovative too.

One thing of note is Beat's current promotion in which AT&T customers can use the service free for 3 months ($10/month is the normal price).

Is it just me, or is this kind of shady?

I'm not sure if I am just being hypersensitive, but doesn't this seem like a possible foray into Net Neutrality woes? I am quite sure my mind is going in that direction due to the [FCC's recent loss][theverge] to Verizon. That probably has a lot to do with it. Still ...

Obviously, Beats and AT&T will argue that this is not unlike AAA customers getting a discount at Disneyland. But we aren't talking about something tangible. We are talking about the internet (more on this later).
