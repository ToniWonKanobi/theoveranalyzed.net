I have been using the new [Beats Music](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beats-music/id781817640?at=1l3vx9s) app for about a week. It had some [troubles initially](http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/beats-music-service-issues/) at launch but overall it takes an interesting [turn away from the status quo](http://www.macstories.net/stories/why-beats-music-matters/) that is [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) and [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/). 

The app itself is actually very good at knowing what I want to listen to -- something Spotify absolutely sucks at, and something Rdio cannot do consistently. The whole "[Sentence](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/9732245/ios_the_sentence_verge_super_wide.jpg)" UI is innovative too.

One thing of note is Beat's current promotion in which AT&T customers can use the service free for 3 months ($10/month is the normal price).

Is it just me, or is this kind of shady?

I'm not sure if I am just being hypersensitive, but doesn't this seem like a possible foray into Net Neutrality woes? I am quite sure my mind is going in that direction due to the [FCC's recent loss](http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/14/5307650/federal-court-strikes-down-net-neutrality-rules) to Verizon. That probably has a lot to do with it. Still ...

Obviously, Beats and AT&T will argue that this is not unlike AAA customers getting a discount at Disneyland. But we aren't talking about something tangible. We are talking about the internet (more on this later).
