I have been using the new [Beats Music][apple] app for about a week. It had some [troubles initially][digitaltrends] at launch but overall it takes an interesting [turn away from the status quo][macstories] that is [Spotify][spotify] and [Rdio][rdio]. 

The app itself is actually very good at knowing what I want to listen to---something Spotify absolutely sucks at, and something Rdio cannot do consistently. The whole "Sentence" UI is pretty innovative as well.

One thing of note is Beat's current promotion in which AT&T customers can use the service free for 3 months ($10/month is the normal price).

Is it just me, or is this kind of shady?

I'm not sure if I am just being hypersensitive, but doesn't this seem like a possible foray into Net Neutrality woes? I am quite sure my mind is going in that direction due to the [FCC's recent loss][theverge] to Verizon. That probably has a lot to do with it. Still ...

Obviously, Beats and AT&T will argue that this is not unlike AAA customers getting a discount at Disneyland. But we aren't talking about something tangible. We are talking about the internet (more on this later).
