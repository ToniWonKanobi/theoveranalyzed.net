![Driveways vs. Parkways][1]

So I'll make it something good. I'll leave you with one of those questions you have probably always thought about, but never found an adequate answer.

Why *do* we drive on parkways and park on driveways? [This][2]:

> Driveways were initially much longer, leading from the road back to the main house on the property. So initially people really did drive on them. The word parkway was used to describe a well developed thoroughfare, complete with trees, grassy divided medians and other landscaping, thus the "park" in the name.
