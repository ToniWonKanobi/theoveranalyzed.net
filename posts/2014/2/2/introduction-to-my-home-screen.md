[What is it about our homescreens](http://lifehacker.com/5991283/how-to-customize-your-iphones-home-screen-and-break-away-from-the-pack) that inspires us to spend hours carefully planning where the apps should go?

Another question: What is it about jailbreak tweaks like [Springtomize](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/01/25/review-springtomize-3/) that inspire so. many. resprings. that my battery goes dead in a few hours? Is the stock UI/UX that terrible? 

Perhaps we are just infernal fiddlers? Perfectionists, maybe?

I think most of us nerds are a mixture of the two.

Throughout this section of my blog, I will be devoting some time to both the apps with which I have chosen to adorn my HS, as well as the Jailbreak tweaks I use to make my iOS experience the best it can be.

You will notice that the arrangement of the apps on my HS is not quite unlike how [Papa Forstall](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/10/show-us-your-phones-home-screen/) intended them from the old iOS 6 days. However, with few exceptions, you will also notice that Apple's first party apps have been replaced with third party apps.

Pundits have been talking about this for years, but criticism of Apple's stock apps was at an all time high during the holiday season of 2012, largely due to the *¡Que horrible!*-ness of Apple Maps:

In general, I prefer the third party alternatives because they offer a more refined feature set, more customizability, and overall, more power user features. 

# Messages #

Practically nobody I know uses WhatsApp or GroupMe, so Messages is the only real messaging client I would use. It gets the job done. However, I do use a couple of tweaks to make the experience better than stock:

[Messages Conversation Photos](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/05/15/messages-convo-photos/) lets me see the pics of my peeps both in the message view, as well as in the list view, which is neat. I'm not sure why Apple doesn't do this by default. Sigh.

[Couria](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/01/28/couria/) is one of many quick reply inspired Messages tweak that allows both swiping lock screen notifications as well as tapping banner notifications to enable a quick reply.

[SwipeSelection Pro](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) works in any app that has keyboard functionality. But what makes it so important for Messages, is that outside of [Tweetbot 3](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/), I spend more time typing in Messages than in any other app.
