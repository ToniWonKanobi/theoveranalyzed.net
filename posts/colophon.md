Title: Colophon  
Description: This page contains somewhat technical details about the author and the site.  

### The Writing

When I write for this site, it's usually on my Mac, a [2015 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display][d]. If I'm at home, said Mac is typically plugged into a [Thunderbolt Display][wikipedia].[^yes] I use a [Magic Keyboard][wikipedia 2], a [Magic Mouse][wikipedia 3], and a [Magic Trackpad 2][apple] (frequently all at the same time). If I'm at [work][twitter], or otherwise not at home, I'm happy typing away on my MacBook Pro.[^int]

I try to listen to music while I'm writing. As long as it's something I've heard [many times before][apple 2],  listening helps me focus. I read a lot of [reviews][marco] and am quite happy with the [B&O PLAY H6][amazon]. Like Marco, I like the treble detail especially. That isn't to say the H6's are bass-lacking---they're just [not overly bass-heavy][marco 2]. In other words, they're very well-rounded. They're also extremely comfortable to wear, which makes longer writing/listening sessions a joy.

My writing app of choice is [Byword][apple 3]. I've tried several other applications such as [Desk.pm][apple 4], [MultiMarkdown Composer][multimarkdown], and [Ulysses][apple 5], but I [always come back][theoveranalyzed] to Byword. Admittedly, the guys at [Metaclassy][metaclassy] probably should update the app and adopt some of MultiMarkdown's [newer features][d 2]. That said, Byword is simply the best way to write everything but really longform pieces on a Mac.

### The Developing

[Camel][github], the static blogging engine powering this site, uses plain [Markdown][daringfireball] `.md` and `.html` files to piece together the site, depending on the endpoint. To develop all the markup and code, [Atom][atom] is my plain-text editor of choice. I've used [Espresso][theoveranalyzed 2], [Visual Studio Code][visualstudio], and [BBEdit][barebones]. They all have their strongpoints, but Atom is the best for me right now. I'd like to try out [Coda][panic], but because of the way TheOverAnalyzed is hosted, that would involve Dropbox and [WebDAV funkiness][dropdav] that just doesn't seem worth it.

### The Serving

This site is hosted on [Heroku][heroku]. I took Casey Liss's [advice][caseyliss] and haven't regretted it once. Truthfully, I'm no backend web developer. Because of that, it could very well be the case that my site would be more performant with a traditional [Apache][wikipedia 4] backend, or regular, ol' [S3][wikipedia 5].

One thing's for sure: with Heroku, the price is right. I currently pay **nothing** to host TheOverAnalyzed.

I have a [Droplr Pro][droplr] account as a backend for media---$9.99/month.[^drop] I use [Hover][hover] as my domain-name registrar, and both the `.net` and `.com` versions of my site end up being around $3.70/month. The webfont served is Ideal Sans from [Hoefler & Co.][typography], and that ends up being $8.25/month.

~$22/month. Not bad.

### The Standards

To my knowledge, this site should conform to [HTML5][wikipedia 6] web standards, and its CSS should validate as well. If you find that an area of the site does not perform as expected, please contact me. Just to be safe, try to use a [non-crappy][duckduckgo] web browser---that helps tremendously. 

### The Disclosures

I own exactly four shares of [Apple stock][nasdaq], purchased sometime last year. I thought it would be funny to see how much I would gain/lose over the next decade. As far as I can tell, that does not affect my writing on Apple.

Most links to iTunes Store and App Store purchases are affiliate links. The same is true for products on Amazon.

I am also a member of an affiliate program for [V-Dog][shareasale], a vegan dog food (see ad at the bottom of every page).

[^drop]: I'm not sure if it was fair to include this in the overall cost per month, because I've used Droplr as a 'regular person' for years. I share *a lot* of screenshots, and Droplr makes that incredibly easy on OS X. (It's relatively less easy on iOS, but as of iOS 8, it's about as easy as it can be for a third party app.)
[^int]: I prefer to type on Apple's newer style keyboards, like the one featured in the [2015 MacBook][d 3], or the new Magic Keyboard. Even though some people [hate the lack of travel][sixcolors], I like the precision of the new keyboards. I look forward to Apple updating the MacBook Pro lineup with new hardware---hardware more inline with the 2015 MacBook.
[^yes]: Yes, I know that the Thunderbolt Display is in dire need of a refresh. And yes, I know (hope) that someday, Apple will release a [glorious 5K panel in a standalone format][reddit]. But [Thunderbolt 3][wikipedia 7] is [a ways off][anandtech]. However, until then, I will happily use this once-great-but-now-fuzzy-looking 27-inch panel from Apple.
