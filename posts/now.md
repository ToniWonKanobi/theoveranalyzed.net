Description: This is what I'm up to recently  

What Am I Up to Right Now?[^1]

* Living in [Southern California][1]
* Working at Hospitality Dental Group and Orthodontics (see <http://anthonycraigdds.com>)
* [Tweaking][2] this website
	* Using Sass to write all the CSS
	* Doing more intelligent stuff with classes instead of nesting selectors (easier to maintain)
* Got a Thunderbolt Display (again), because the HydraDock just wasn't shipping
