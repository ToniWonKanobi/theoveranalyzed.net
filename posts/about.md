Description: Info about me and TheOverAnalyzed  

Hi. I'm [Anthony][1] ü§ì

![Allison and I ‚ù§Ô∏è][2]

TheOverAnalyzed is a website about technology, design, and pop culture. Also <i>Star Wars</i>---a lot of [Star Wars][3].

### How This Came to Be

After months of hearing on my favorite [podcast][4] various advertisements for [Squarespace][5], I took the plunge and started my own blog in [early 2014][6]: TheOverAnalyzed. I had no formal web development or design background, but I am a quick learner and a pretty well-rounded nerd. Blogging seemed like an outlet as well as a way to learn some new things.

I eventually found that even on Squarespace's Developer Platform, not *everything* was open for tweaking. I wanted something better, but wasn't sure I had the skills to leave a CMS and take on a self-hosted website.

In early 2015, I caught wind of [Casey Liss's][7] blogging engine, [Camel][8], which he open-sourced [months earlier][9]. With the option for an [alternate][10] RSS feed and the openness of a completely customizable platform, I knew that was the direction I would eventually head. I procrastinated for a month before finally starting work on Version 3.0 of the site.

Thanks for stopping by üôÉ
