# About

I'm Anthony Craig.

In early 2014, after months of hearing on my favorite [podcast](http://atp.fm) about the wonders of [Squarespace](www.squarespace.com), I started my own blog. I have no formal web development or design background, but I fancy myself a quick learner and a decently well-rounded nerd. It seemed like a neat way to learn some new things.

Version 1 through version [2.5](https://instagram.com/p/2oFqCowLyD/?taken-by=theoveranalyzed) of TheOverAnalyzed was built on the Squarespace platform and several of its templates. The site was never stock, however. From nearly the beginning, it was heavily augmented with *tons* of [hacks](@@SiteRoot@@/tags/hacking-squarespace) to make everything appear how I wanted. More than anything, this blog has been an extreme exercise in patience. Things didn't always work out on the first try, but when they did, it was a [great feeling](https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/601133285356531712).

All the while, I knew I wanted something better than Squarepace. Too many simple tasks were made difficult using Squarespace, and too *few* difficult tasks were made simple using Squarespace. But in the beginning, I lacked both the skills and courage to leave Squarespace.

In mid 2014, Casey Liss [open-sourced](http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/5/2/camel-open-sourced) his lightweight blogging engine, [Camel](https://github.com/cliss/camel). With the option for an '[alternate RSS](@@SiteRoot@@/rss-alternate)' feed (linked posts point back to TheOverAnalyzed) and the openness of a completely customizable platform, I knew that was the direction I would eventually head. So in mid 2015, I did just that. Head over to [/nerd](@@SiteRoot@@/nerd) for more information.

Thanks for stopping by.
