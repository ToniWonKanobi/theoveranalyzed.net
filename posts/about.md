I'm [Anthony][ant].

After months of hearing on my favorite [podcast][atp] various advertisements for [Squarespace][ss], I took the plunge and started my own blog in [early 2014][ear]: TheOverAnalyzed. I had no formal web development or design background, but I am a quick learner and a pretty well-rounded nerd. Blogging seemed like an outlet as well as a way to learn some new things.

Consequently, Versions 1 through [2.5][instagram] of the site were built on the Squarespace platform, across a couple of its templates. Version 1 was mostly stock, but about 6 months after starting the site, I accessed their Developer Platform, hoping it would allow me to tweak the site even more. I was exposed to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- languages I knew nothing about previously. Based on what I learned from stalking other people's CSS, as well as what I gathered from all corners of the internet, I employed tons of [hacks][hacks] to make everything appear how I wanted. CSS isn't particularly easy to get right on the first try. But when things finally worked out, boy was it a [great feeling][twitter]. Check out posts tagged [TheOverAnalyzed][toa] for a history of the site's various stages of development.

I eventually found that even on Squarespace's Developer Platform, not *everything* was open for tweaking. Ultimately, too many simple tasks were made difficult using Squarespace, and too *few* difficult tasks were made simple using Squarespace. I knew I wanted something better, but wasn't sure I had the skills to leave a CMS and take on a self-hosted website.

In early 2015, I caught wind of Casey Liss's blogging engine, Camel, which he open-sourced [months earlier][caseyliss]. With the option for an ['alternate'][rssa] RSS feed (linked posts point back to TheOverAnalyzed) and the openness of a completely customizable platform, I knew that was the direction I would eventually head. I procrastinated for a month before finally starting work on Version 3.0 of the site. Head over to [/nerd][nerd] for more technical information about the site.

Thanks for stopping by.
