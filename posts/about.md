# About #

Hi. 

My name is Anthony Craig.

## History ##

In early 2014, after months of hearing on my favorite [podcasts](http://atp.fm) about the wonders of Squarespace, I contemplated starting my own blog. I have no formal web development or design background, but I fancy myself a quick learner and a decently well-rounded nerd. 

Version 1 through version [2.5](https://instagram.com/p/2oFqCowLyD/?taken-by=theoveranalyzed) of my TheOverAnalyzed was built using the Squarespace platform and several of its templates. The site was never stock, however. It was heavily augmented with *tons* of hacks to make everything appear how I wanted. More than anything, it had been an extreme exercise in patience. I knew I wanted something better, but in the beginning, I lacked both the skills and courage to leave Squarespace.

## Now ##

In mid 2014, Casey Liss [open-sourced](http://www.caseyliss.com/2014/5/2/camel-open-sourced) his lightweight blogging engine, [Camel](https://github.com/cliss/camel). With the option for an 'alternate RSS' feed (for friends and family) and the offering of a completely customizable platform, I knew that was the direction I would eventually head. Too many simple tasks were made difficult using Squarespace, and too *few* difficult tasks were made simple using Squarespace.

## Nerd ##

In addition to using a [forked version](https://github.com/DataMcFly/camel) of Casey's engine, I have employed several additional open-source JavaScript tweaks, [Bigfoot](http://bigfootjs.com) (for fancy footnotes), and [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com) (for auto-width `<iframe>` content). Both are relatively lightweight, and should render quickly in most modern browsers. You should check them out.

Thanks for stopping by.
