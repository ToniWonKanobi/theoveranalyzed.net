It’s not just the download size, long initial page load time, and the ads that cover valuable screen real estate as fixed elements. The fact that these JavaScript trackers hit the network for a full-minute after the page has completely loaded is downright criminal. Advertising should have minimal effect on page load times and device battery life. Advertising should be respectful of the user’s time, attention, and battery life. The industry has gluttonously gone the other way. **iMore is not the exception — they’re the norm** [emphasis added]. 10+ MB page sizes, minute-long network access, third-party networks tracking you across unrelated websites — those things are all par for the course today, even when serving pages to mobile devices. Even on a site like iMore, staffed by good people who truly have deep respect for their readers.

When iPhone [launched in 2007][wikipedia 4] with a version of the venerable Safari web browser, the advertisement firms took advantage. That trend has only increased in the 8 years thereafter. Just visit any major .com news organization and you'll see what I mean. The browser window will no doubt be filled with advertisements, most of which look like shat. It's not just that most mobile ads have horribly-pixelated versions of whatever product or service the ad is peddling. No, moreover: those ads typically obscure a *major* portion of the content.
