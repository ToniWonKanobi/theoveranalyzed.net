I hadn't previously used the Audubon app before seeing this article. And, full disclosure: this seems like a promoted post for [Green Mountain Digital][1]. It reads an awful lot like an ad read. Still, this app is worth checking out if you like birds.[^1]

As an aside: I wholeheartedly recommend the [Peterson Birds][2] app over Audubon's. When I was looking for bird apps in the App Store back in the day, Audubon's didn't even have iPhone 5 support, while Peterson's did. So I chose them, and I have been using the Peterson app ever since having an iOS device.
