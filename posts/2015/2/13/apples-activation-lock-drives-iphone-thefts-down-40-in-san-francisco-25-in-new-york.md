When I had an Android device a couple of years ago, I found myself uneasy from time to time for a myriad or reasons. One reason concerned iMessage and SMS. The [issue][imore] has been well documented: previous iPhone/iMessage users moving to another platform often had incoming messages undelivered, due to the way Apple engineers implemented iMessage. That issue has since been [resolved][technobuffalo], more or less.

Another reason I was uneasy was the camera. It just [sucked][gottabemobile]. No doubt about it. And what's crazy is that the new Nexus cameras *[still][gizmodo]* suck. 

The third reason I was not comfortable with my Android device was the lack of theft-protection. At that time, there was no true Android version of [Find my iPhone][apple], just [hacky solutions][pcmag]. There was no Activation Lock. If someone wanted to steal that piece of junk phone of mine, they could have. And I would probably have never gotten it back.

One of the many ways Apple innovates is in the details. This should be no surprise to you. Some of the details get forgotten, or pushed aside for the more news-worthy details. It's nice to see such a seemingly small aspect of iOS ownership get heralded as much as Activation Lock is right now.
