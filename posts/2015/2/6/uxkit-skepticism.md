![UXKit Skepticism][1]

Brent Simmons of Inessential.com on Apple's implementation of UXKit in the [new Photos.app beta][2]:

> The point would be to make cross-platform development a little quicker — but it wouldn’t get you out of using UIKit and AppKit.

Imagine how cool it would be to know one language, but simultaneously 'develop' for multiple platforms? An iOS app *and* an OS X app, but without the headache. It doesn't sound like UXKit will be that, but maybe this is a step in that direction?
