It wasn't long after I got my iPhone 5 that I started feeling like Facebook wasn't for me anymore. 

Like everyone else, I [checked out Twitter,](https://twitter.com/ToniWonKanobi/statuses/242981123301453827)[^tw] and also [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/toniwonkanobi/post/1130894). 

Three years later, and only one of those two services is still alive.[^sa] It's crazy how much things can change in a few years. 

Back in 2012, [Twitter had only recently started to crack down on third-party clients](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/03/twitter-tells-third-party-devs-to-stop-making-twitter-client-apps/) using their APIs. And there were plenty of [third-party clients](https://quixey.studio.quixey.com/search?q=store%20twitter%20client) on the App Store. The best examples of which were [Tweetbot](https://web.archive.org/web/20120906232823/http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) and [Twitterrific](https://web.archive.org/web/20121101170526/http://twitterrific.com/iphone/).

Ecstatic with the concept of apps (this was my first iPhone), I downloaded both and tried both. 

They were amazing. Unlike a lot of long-time iPhone owners using Twitter, I was never forced to use the official Twitter client, on iOS *or* Mac OS X.[^os] I even used [both at the same time,](http://d.pr/i/gML7+) just for kicks.[^fk]

While Tweetbot 2's visual esthetic was, in 2012, much heavier and less 'flat'[^flt] than Twitterrific's at the time, I loved the look. Combined with my preference for the Tweetbot esthetic, the power user features also made Tweetbot more compelling for me than Twitterrific.

Yesterday, Tapbots launched their newly-redesigned website. They had [this](http://tapbots.com/news/15-2-26-new-website-new-focus/) to say about the change:
>Welcome to the new tapbots.com! We hope this long overdue refresh is a better place to stay up to date with our apps. Our goal this year is to not only ship updates on a more regular basis, but also provide more insight into what we are currently working on. So lets get on to the important bits of information.

[Mark Jardine](www.twitter.com/markjardine), designer for Tapbots since its inception, did a great job with the site's new look.

You can check out their new site, as well as all of their wonderful apps [here](http://tapbots.com).

[^tw]: Here's my [first tweet ever](https://twitter.com/ToniWonKanobi/statuses/113085950388748289), auto-posted from -- get this -- iTunes. 
[^sa]: Notice how I didn't say "thrive?" It will be interesting to see how things look for Twitter three years from *today*. 
[^os]: [Boom](https://web.archive.org/web/20121207191103/http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/).
[^fk]: [Tweet Marker](http://tweetmarker.net) made Timeline syncing easy, and I wasn't too bothered with the lack of DM / @mention syncing, since I wasn't getting many of those at the time anyways.
[^flt]: Flat was so in back then. I guess it still is, but it's more 'flat, and non-flat when needed,' which I like much better. Tapbots really has taken this new 'flat' and ran with it. While Tweetbot and [Calcbot](http://tapbots.com/calcbot/) are still technically quite flat compared to older versions pre-iOS 7, they both have tons of delicious animations and textures that enhance the app experience tremendously. Sometimes plain ol' flat just doesn't work that well.
