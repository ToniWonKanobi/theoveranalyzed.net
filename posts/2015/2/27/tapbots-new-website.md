It wasn't long after I got my iPhone 5 that I started feeling like Facebook wasn't for me anymore. 

Like everyone else, I [checked out Twitter,][twitter][^tw] and also [App.net][app]. 

Three years later, and only one of those two services is still alive.[^sa] It's crazy how much things can change in a few years. 

Back in 2012, [Twitter had only recently started to crack down on third-party clients][arstechnica] using their APIs. And there were plenty of [third-party clients][studio] on the App Store. The best examples of which were [Tweetbot][archive] and [Twitterrific][archive 2].

Ecstatic with the concept of apps (this was my first iPhone), I downloaded both and tried both. Unlike a lot of iPhone owners on Twitter, I was never forced to use the official Twitter client, on iOS *or* Mac OS X.[^os]

	<figcaption>I even used both Twitterrific and Tweetbot at the same time. <a href="http://tweetmarker.net">Tweet Marker</a> made Timeline syncing easy, and I wasn't too bothered with the lack of DM / @mention syncing between clients, since I wasn't getting many of those at the time anyways.</figcaption>

While Tweetbot 2's visual esthetic was, in 2012, much heavier and less 'flat'[^flt] than Twitterrific's at the time, I loved the look. Combined with my preference for the Tweetbot esthetic, the power user features also made Tweetbot more compelling for me than Twitterrific.

Yesterday, Tapbots launched their newly-redesigned website. They had [this][tapbots] to say about the change:
>Welcome to the new tapbots.com! We hope this long overdue refresh is a better place to stay up to date with our apps. Our goal this year is to not only ship updates on a more regular basis, but also provide more insight into what we are currently working on. So lets get on to the important bits of information.

[Mark Jardine][twitter 2], designer for Tapbots since its inception, did a great job with the site's new look.

You can check out their new site, as well as all of their wonderful apps [here][tapbots 2].

[^tw]: Here's my [first tweet ever][twitter 3], auto-posted from -- get this -- iTunes. 
[^sa]: Notice how I didn't say "thrive"? It will be interesting to see how things look for Twitter three years from *today*. 
[^os]: [Boom][archive 3].
[^flt]: Flat was so in back then. I guess it still is, but it's more 'flat, and non-flat when needed,' which I like much better. Tapbots really has taken this new 'flat' and ran with it. While Tweetbot and [Calcbot][tapbots 3] are still technically quite flat compared to older versions pre-iOS 7, they both have tons of delicious animations and textures that enhance the app experience tremendously. Sometimes plain ol' flat just doesn't work that well.
