Chris Ziegler  for the Verge:
>I’m pretty sure Dom has been saying “one last ride” every movie since the first, except for the second one and Tokyo Drift because he’s not in those.

I'll be the first to admit that the [entire Furious lineup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious) is a horrid and flawed take on car culture in America.[^am] Ever since the first one, critics agree these movies are [terrible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious#Reception). 

If you can make it through Ziegler's piece regarding Furious 7's [Super Bowl trailer](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/1/7960981/fast-and-furious-7-trailer-superbowl-commercial-2015) yesterday, his final sentence captures completely how must of us feel about this franchise:
>Have I mentioned that I'm excited for this film?

Me too, man. Me too. 

[^am]: I was tempted to say "abroad" here, but really, even though several of the movies have large portions dedicated to non-US locales, the movies are still about car culture in America (which is, if you recall, the greatest country for car culture).
