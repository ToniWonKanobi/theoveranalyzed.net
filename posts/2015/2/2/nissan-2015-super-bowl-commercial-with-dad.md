This has to be the best commercial for this year's Super Bowl. The [Budweiser][youtube] one was a little off-putting this year.[^y]

[^y]: Why would their marketing team make *wolves* the bad guys? This is especially precarious because of all the [controversy][humanesociety] surrounding wolves as of late.
