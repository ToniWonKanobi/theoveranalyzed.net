Although digital imaging has swept the industry with its convenience, ease of use, and cost-effective nature, several directors still prefer to use film for its inherent qualities. Recent movies like Boyhood, Interstellar, and The Imitation Game were all shot on film, and upcoming blockbusters including Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice will be filmed using Kodak products.
 
I like this. Keeping the old ways alive. 
 
Reminds me of the [964][wikipedia]. Some Porsche purists put that generation of 911 at the top of the pedestal when it comes to the air-cooled era. The [993][wikipedia 2] was, technically speaking, the absolute pinnacle, what with its revised suspension geometry,[^g] and overall modernization of the platform. While the 993 had numerous improvements over its predecessors, one thing it did away with was the hand-craftsmanship. Yes, that's right: the 964 was the last generation of 911's to be mostly hand-built. Are you reading me? An actual awesome German person used their hands to put together that wonderful piece of automobilia. And while I'm sure the production process for the 993 generation and onward was made _easier_ by incorporating more machines and less humans, I argue that something was lost. Something intangible. 

In 50 years we might look back to today, and the idea of using film to produce motion pictures might seem crazy. Still, that doesn't mean we can't continue to enjoy the medium, as long as it's available, right? 
 
Long live the past.
