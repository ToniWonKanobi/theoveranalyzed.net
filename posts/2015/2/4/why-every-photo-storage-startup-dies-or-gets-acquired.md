Casey Newton for The Verge:

> But the startups keep dying. First Everpix went under. Then Loom, a kind of infinite camera roll, sold to Dropbox and formed the basis for Carousel. Now Picturelife belongs to StreamNation, which aspires to become the hub for all your digital files: movies, music, and photos.

I remember being excited with I found [Loom][loom] a while ago. It had a great premise: [Everpix][everpix], but not dead. Well, guess what? They got dead. Sort of. [Dropbox rolled Loom into their portfolio][loom 2] and launched [Carousel][dropbox], which was pretty terrible. 

The general consensus amongst the Apple development corner of the internet is that everyone is waiting for [Photos][9to5mac] to launch.[^l] From what I remember of WWDC 2014 and the September Event, it had some compelling features. Most importantly, though: it promised to [just work][techcrunch]. iPhoto is a behemoth approaching the size and bulk of iTunes. No one wants another iPhoto. I have been using iCloud Photos (Beta) for a [while][appleinsider].  It has worked well enough for me. 

Let us hope that this extra time Apple is devoting to the Photos rollout will be for a good purpose.

[^l]: I would have included a hyperlink to the actual multi-platform Photos service, but Apple has since removed all mention of it on their website. Interesting.
