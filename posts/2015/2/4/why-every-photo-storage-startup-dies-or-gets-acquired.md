Casey Newton for The Verge:
>But the startups keep dying. First Everpix went under. Then Loom, a kind of infinite camera roll, sold to Dropbox and formed the basis for Carousel. Now Picturelife belongs to StreamNation, which aspires to become the hub for all your digital files: movies, music, and photos.

I remember being excited with I found [Loom](https://loom.com) a while ago. It had a great premise: [Everpix](http://www.everpix.com), but not dead. Well, guess what? They got dead. Sort of. [Dropbox rolled Loom into their portfolio](https://blog.loom.com/loom-is-joining-dropbox-2) and launched [Carousel](https://carousel.dropbox.com/), which was pretty terrible. 

The general consensus amongst the Apple development corner of the internet is that everyone is waiting for [Photos](http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/02/apple-announces-new-photos-app-for-mac/) to launch.[^1] From what I remember of WWDC 2014 and the September Event, it had some compelling features. Most importantly, though: it promised to [just work](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/apple-icloud-google-cloud/). iPhoto is a behemoth approaching the size and bulk of iTunes. No one wants another iPhoto. I have been using iCloud Photos (Beta) for a [while](http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/10/18/apple-launches-icloud-photos-beta-web-client-ahead-of-ios-81-rollout).  It has worked well enough for me. 

Let us hope that this extra time Apple is devoting to the Photos rollout will be for a good purpose.
