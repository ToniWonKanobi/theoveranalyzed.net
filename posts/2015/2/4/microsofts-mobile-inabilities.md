Jim Dalrymple of The Loop, reporting on a piece by [Om Malik][om]:
>Microsoft has a long history of not getting product trends. They didnâ€™t get the iPod, tablets, iPhone and a host of other products that it could have made a lot of money on.

Dalrymple's next sentence is profound:[^sar]
>Microsoft is profit-focused, which means it makes shitty products. 

I'm not sure I agree completely here. Apple is profit-focused too, but not in the same way.

On Apple:
>Apple is product-focused, which means people buy the quality and Apple makes a lot of money.

Microsoft missed the boat on mobile, there's no denying that. And it sure is laughable that they had to acquire smaller companies *just* to get decent front end apps to mesh with their temperamental backend services. That said, I'm hopeful the Redmond team can come up with something grand. Otherwise all seven of those Lumia owners are going to be really disappointed.
