Smart of them to get on this before April, when [*it*][1] launches. 

If Apple culture and products weren't such a part of me, I would jump on this. $159 is cheap---CHEAP---for a smartwatch. It is everything consumers could want in a smartwatch: great design, great UI, and great [battery life][2]. And perhaps most interesting of all: instead of being it's biggest *drawback*, Pebble Time's color e-paper display is it's biggest *feature*. Imagine Samsung trying to posit an e-paper display as a feature. Yeah, funny.
