I am no [Ben Thompson](http://www.twitter.com/monkbent), so this intrigued me. 

Here is Investopedia's result for the query "law of large numbers":
>A principle of probability and statistics which states that as a sample size grows, its mean will get closer and closer to the average of the whole population. The law of large numbers in the financial context has a different connotation, **which is that a large entity which is growing rapidly cannot maintain that growth pace forever** [emphasis added].

Ah. This made more sense to me, especially in light of the criticism leveled against Apple for its software efforts of late.
