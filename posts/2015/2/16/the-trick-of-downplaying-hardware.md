>[He] reiterated that Apple has never been a hardware company but is instead all about the software.

Cybart goes on:

Recently, prominent members of the development community[^an] have criticized Apple's software efforts, most notably the [often-misconstrued][marco] [piece][marco 2] by Marco Arment. 

Moreover, Wall Street and The Valley might appreciate Apple's shifting focus to software, because as Cybart states, they "simply don't understand hardware."
