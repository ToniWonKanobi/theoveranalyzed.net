Neil Cybart of Above Avalon, on Tim Cook's conversation with Goldman Sachs:

> [He] reiterated that Apple has never been a hardware company but is instead all about the software.

Cybart goes on:

> Apple is purposely downplaying hardware, which by incident is validation that hardware is a crucial piece to Apple's success. [...] Why downplay hardware? They want to direct attention elsewhere.

Now that Apple is clearly [big time][1], Cybart argues, Apple wants to focus on the areas of their business which are not juggernaut successes. Recently, prominent members of the development community[^1] have criticized Apple's software efforts, most notably the [often-misconstrued][2] [piece][3] by Marco Arment. 

Moreover, Wall Street and The Valley might appreciate Apple's shifting focus to software, because as Cybart states, they "simply don't understand hardware."
