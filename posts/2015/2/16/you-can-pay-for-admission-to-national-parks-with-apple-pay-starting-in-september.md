Casey Newton from The Verge, quoting Apple's CEO:
>Cook said Apple was determined to end our reliance on physical wallets. “We can imagine a day the not-so-distant future when your wallet becomes a remnant of the past,” he said. “Your passport, your driver’s license, and other important documents can be digitally stored in a way that’s safe, secure, and easy to access.”
