Casey Newton from The Verge, quoting Apple's CEO:

> Cook said Apple was determined to end our reliance on physical wallets. “We can imagine a day the not-so-distant future when your wallet becomes a remnant of the past,” he said. “Your passport, your driver’s license, and other important documents can be digitally stored in a way that’s safe, secure, and easy to access.”

I'll be the first to criticize the government for being, well, the government. 

But this is just plain awesome 🌄
