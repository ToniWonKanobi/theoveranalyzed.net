Aside: Isn't it so cool to find out popular artists actually know something about music? Usher plays[^us] [some] bass. Good to know.

By the way, while this song is totes uplifting musically speaking, it is a [complete downer lyrically][wikipedia].

[^us]: Who am I to judge, but, judging by his left hand position and his finger style, I'd venture to guess that bass guitar is nothing more than an occasional musical interest of his. But I could be wrong.
