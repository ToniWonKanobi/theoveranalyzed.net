Usher plays[^1] \[some\] bass.

Good to know.

By the way, while this song is totes uplifting musically speaking, it is a [complete downer lyrically][1].

[^1]: Who am I to judge, but, judging by his left hand position and his finger style, I'd venture to guess that bass guitar is nothing more than an occasional musical interest of his. But I could be wrong.
