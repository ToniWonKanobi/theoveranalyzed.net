Luis Abreu wrote a [piece][lmjabreu] yesterday outlining his experience interviewing for a job at Apple:

It's the dream, isn't it? To work for that small-ish company in Cupertino? 

Everything except for the whole getting hired part, apparently. 

<hr class="small"/>

Over the past 2-3 months, I have been on a whirlwind experience looking for a new job. 

I left my previous [job][pacificdentalservices] in a corporate dental office for various reasons.[^pds] 

What I wish I would have known/realized[^kr] is that in the saturated region of Southern California in which I live, it is *hard* to find a decent dental office from which to hail. Don't get me wrong: I am happy to be free of the heavy corporate hand. I feel how Jason Snell probably felt after leaving [IDG][snellworld].[^idg] 

<div class="takehome"><p><i>Do they want me to be hard working and talk about how I want 5 days per week, or do they want me to seem laid back, and not super producer?</i></p></div>

But there is only so much interviewing one human can do in a given period of time. Some of the offices I have been to have been ...less than ideal. Let me put it this way: I wouldn't let some of these places perform irreversible surgical procedures on my teeth, that's for sure. Oh well. You never know from a Craigslist ad. 

But even worse than the quality of the offices are the *games one has to play in the interview*. The entire time a potential employer is grilling me, all I can do is think about what the next question might be, and how I can best answer it. 

<hr class="small"/>

I read people and size them up all day long. I have to. Most people aren't comfortable at the dentist. I know I'm not. You're laid back, in this vulnerable position, just *hoping* that the guy won't say you need anything done. I empathize wholeheartedly.

But I also know that when people have such walls up, it is hard to ascertain what exactly it is they want/need. That's why I have to read people. 

That is hard enough as it is.

**I certainly didn't expect to have to do the same in job interviews.**

Maybe it's because I have been on so many? Hard to say.

What I take home from Abreu's story is solace; at least I'm not alone.

[^pds]: Someday I'll talk more about this.
[^idg]: Another interesting tidbit: just as his departure from IDG coincided with the launch of his personal blog, [Six Colors][sixcolors], my own departure from my job at PDS led to my spending *a lot* more time on my blog here. It's funny how big, planned life changes often lead to other equally big, *unplanned* life changes.
[^kr]: The grass is always greener.
