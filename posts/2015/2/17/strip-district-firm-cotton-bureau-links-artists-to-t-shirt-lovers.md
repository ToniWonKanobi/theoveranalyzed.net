Today, The Pittsburg Tribune-Review profiled my favorite apparel company ever, [Cotton Bureau][cottonbureau]. 

David Conti, quoting somebody familiar to me:
>“For my generation of people who look at Internet shopping as something as normal as walking into Macy's, Cotton Bureau has really catered to us,” said devoted customer Anthony Craig, 27, a dentist and blogger in Loma Linda, Calif., who has bought more than 20 shirts at the site.

>He noted the unique designs targeted at “techie” buyers, an easy process for making purchases and a crowd-sourced vibe for deciding which shirts get printed.

>“If you want it, you need to jump on it and buy it,” Craig said. “We don't want things to pass us up. Buy now, or you might miss it.”

Taking a step back, I'm not sure its possible to pinpoint the exact reasons as to why the Bureau is so compelling. The problem is that there are just so many. When Conti spoke with me a few days ago, I'm sure I sounded like a star-struck teenage girl, elated after just meeting Britney Spears backstage after she [opened for N'SYNC in the late 90's][wikipedia]. 

I think I first heard about Cotton Bureau when [Tapbots][tapbots] had its [first t-shirt run][twitter] about a year ago. I have been a frequent patron ever since.

These guys are offering something really great here, and on any given day, I dare you to stop by their site and *not* find something worth spending $25. They are empowering small-timers like me, which is awesome.

It's a small-ish shop, and their customer service still says as much. A few months back I ordered a shirt and it ended up being uncharacteristically large for a Medium. I sent an email, and then, that same night, I got a reply from [Sara Gardinier][twitter 2], their customer service email guru. She said it wouldn't be a problem, and that they would have another one to me as soon as possible.

Boom. Just like that. 

Try having that same experience at your local Wal-Mart. Oh you forgot your receipt? Too bad. ["Always low prices. Always. Wal-Mart."][usatoday]
