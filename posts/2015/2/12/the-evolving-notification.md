Neil Cybart with Above Avalon:
>Apple Watch has the potential to put the notification back on track. With the expectation that the device will be worn on the wrist for most of the day, an Apple Watch will not only add personalization and customization to notifications, but it will transform the way we think of notifications in mobile. Apple Watch will turn notifications into a new form of communication.

Admittedly, my desire for an Apple Watch is steeped somewhat in the reality that I just like everything Apple makes, and, accordingly, I want to be an early adopter of all their technologies. Still, there are some compelling reasons to have an Apple Watch.
 
*This has to be at the top of the list. *

Ever since having an iPhone, I have painstakingly curated my notifications. For the most part, they are turned off. I don't ever use Notification Center, and rely more on Lock Screen notifications or app icon badges for select apps instead. Pop down / Alert notifications are disabled as well. Why? Because I hate being bothered when I'm doing something, and I hate having that nagging feeling of "Oh, something just made noise in my pocket. I wonder if I should check it?"

Apple Watch will be a huge paradigm shift. Instead of being beholden to my phone, always having to take it out of my pocket, invoke the display, and then decide if the notification is worth an action,[^1] Apple Watch can tell me, with one glance, whether the notification is worth my attention *at that moment.* Boom.
