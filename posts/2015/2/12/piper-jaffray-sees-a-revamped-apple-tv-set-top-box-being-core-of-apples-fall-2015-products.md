In a surprising turn of events, Piper Jaffray says Apple TV should be a big deal in 2015. This is completely different from [last year](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/12/17/munster-apple-tv-set-2016/) and the [year before](http://www.businessinsider.com/no-apple-tv-until-november-2013-says-analyst-gene-munster-2012-11?op=1), in which Gene Munster successfully predicted a new Apple TV. Oh wait. No. That never happened.[^gm]
