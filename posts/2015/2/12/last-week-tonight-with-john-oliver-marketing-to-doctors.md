A good example of John Oliver doing his thing. 

For the most part, the dental industry[^di] has been spared from this level of marketing. Sure, there are probably about a trillion different flowable composite resins to choose from, and there are probably representatives from [GC][gcamerica], [Kerr][kerrdental], and [Kuraray][kuraraydental] that want to come to your office and sell you their version. They might even buy you lunch. 

But nothing, *nothing* in my professional world compares to this apparently horrid marketing campaign occurring right now in the medical world. 

[^di]: I hesitate to put this word, but really, dentistry is an industry just like the toilet paper industry. Huge corporations make their money selling things to a lot of people, and dentists are people too. Crazy, but true.
