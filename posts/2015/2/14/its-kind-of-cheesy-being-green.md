>If I worked at Apple Iâ€™d be pretty psyched with this reaction. After all, what is a more powerful brand amplifier than social pressure? If people who converse in green bubbles start to feel relatively poor, or socially inferior, because they chose to use a less-expensive pocket supercomputer than those made by Apple, that could lead to iPhone sales. Ugly green bubbles = <text>$$$$$</text> and promotions.

I've talked about how terrible the Nexus 4 camera was. One thing I have not talked about was Android/iMessage/SMS.

Simply put, I completely took for granted being able to have messages synced on all my devices. When I had an Android device, I would often have multiple conversations going, with the same people, all at the same time. Multiple threads of irritation. 

What a terrible time in my life.
