#### Eight years ago today, we went on [our first 'big' date](http://d.pr/i/1h9Gt+)

<hr>

#### Years later, it isn't *that* date I remember best -- it's [all the small ones that followed](http://d.pr/i/17c8+)

<hr>

#### It's hard to put to words [my feelings for her](http://d.pr/i/1cA8c+)

<hr>

#### I never knew what true love was before her, and without her, [I don't think I could ever know it again](http://d.pr/i/12lD8+)

<hr>

#### Over the years, days have gone by in which the monotony of life has gotten the better of me, causing me to forget [just how special she is](http://d.pr/i/1aaa8+)

<hr>

#### Still, every evening I walk through that door, only to find the most [wonderful and exquisite creature](http://d.pr/i/1l05R+) waiting for me on the other side

<hr>

#### That never gets old

<hr>

#### She's the one with whom [I have shared everything](http://d.pr/i/133Ap+)

<hr>

#### And best of all, we have [so many more years ahead of us](http://d.pr/i/1jbcu+)

<hr>

#### I love you

![Love](http://d.pr/i/11ITs+)
