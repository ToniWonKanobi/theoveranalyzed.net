Kelsey McKinney for Vox, on Taylor Swift's latest, <i>Style</i>:

> All of the songs on this album are 100% pop. You know, some of them tell stories. They aren't stories like she was telling on [Fearless][wikipedia] or [Speak Now][wikipedia 2]. 

If you like pop music, you should watch this. McKinney uses ol' TSwift as a form for explaining the anatomy of a great pop record. 

Topics covered:

* Why is *Style* so dang catchy?
* Why are other pop songs so dang catchy?

A great watch for [Swifties][urbandictionary] or any fan of pop music.
