Kelsey McKinney for Vox, on Taylor Swift's latest video for Style:
>All of the songs on this album are 100% pop. You know, some of them tell stories. They aren't stories like she was telling on [Fearless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_album)) or [Speak Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now). 

If you like pop music, you should watch this. McKinney uses ol' TSwift as a form for explaining the anatomy of a great pop record. 

Topics covered: 
1. Why is Style so dang catchy?
2. Why are some pop songs just *so* dang catchy?

A great watch for [Swifties](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=swiftie) or any fan of pop music.
