Chris Ziegler for The Verge: 
>"Tablet-like"? What kind of jacked-up tablet are you using, Subaru?

Before I had an iPhone, we used a portable in-car navigation unit from Magellan. It was terrible. Even in 2007, before the world knew [what touch screens could offer][tuaw], I knew the Magellan was terrible. "Maggie," we called her. I had to boot into Windows to update her, and even then, she still sucked.

Car companies have been putting out navigation systems with about as much awesomeness as Magellan in 2007. That is to say, car system navigations aren't awesome. They are terrible.

[CarPlay][apple] has been a long time coming. [Android Auto][android] seems even better. Finallyâ„¢ we can harness the power of our cellular devices and access often-updating databases to help us get where we need to. And with these new interfaces from Apple and Google, it can look/feel nice too. Whilst driving, UI/UX is *more* important than when sitting at a chair reading. It's imperative that menus are responsive. 

Subaru clearly missed the memo on that last part.
