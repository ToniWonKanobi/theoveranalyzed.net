Jason Koebler of Motherboard/Vice, quoting Matthew Markus of [Pembient][2]:

> We don’t think this will be a silver bullet, we think it’s a leg of a triangle to reverse a trend in poaching. You have law enforcement, you have a demand reduction strategy, and now we could be this alternative supply leg that’s been absent,” he said. “Think about the fur industry—there’s laws about poaching, there’s demand reduction through groups like PETA, and then there’s synthetic furs. What’s missing in Asia is the availability of replica products.

Quite a novel approach to the [immense problem of poaching][3].
