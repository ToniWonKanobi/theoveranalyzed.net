Think back twenty years (were you even born questionmark). Can you imagine a 'small-timer' like [Louisa Wendroff][twitter] [making it big][billboard] without YouTube?[^yt] I can't either. What I also can't imagine is how different YouTube might have been if [Google never bought them][gizmodo],[^gb] and there were no net neutrality. The first scenario sounds not that bad.[^ci] The second scenario sounds horrible. Wendroff could never had made it in a world without net neutrality. Thank goodness for [this][arstechnica]

[^yt]: (Or without [Tae][twitter 2])
[^gb]: Stupid Google.
[^ci]: No more [evil][huffingtonpost]?
