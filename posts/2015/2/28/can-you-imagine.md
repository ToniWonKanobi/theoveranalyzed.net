Think back twenty years (were you even born questionmark).

Can you imagine a 'small-timer' like [Louisa Wendroff](https://twitter.com/louisawendorff) [making it big](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6436391/taylor-swift-tweet-no-1-louisa-wendorff) without YouTube?[^yt]

I can't either. 

What I also can't imagine is how different YouTube might have been if:

1. [Google never bought them](http://gizmodo.com/206331/official-google-buys-youtube),[^gb] and
2. There were no net neutrality

The first one I can imagine.[^ci]

The second I cannot.
