Think back twenty years (were you even born questionmark). Can you imagine a 'small-timer' like [Louisa Wendroff][1] [making it big][2] without YouTube?[^1] I can't either. What I also can't imagine is how different YouTube might have been if [Google never bought them][3], [^2] and there were no net neutrality. The first scenario sounds not that bad.[^3] The second scenario sounds horrible. Wendroff could never had made it in a world without net neutrality. Thank goodness for [this][4].

[^1]: Or without [Tae][a]?
[^2]: Stupid Google.
[^3]: No more [evil][b]?
