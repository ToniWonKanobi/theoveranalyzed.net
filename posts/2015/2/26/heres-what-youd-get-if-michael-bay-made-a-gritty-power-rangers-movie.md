Yes, I watched this. 

As a former Power Rangers diehard, I wanted to know what this guy envisioned for the Mighty Morphin' kids fate in the future.

It's obviously a low-production indie piece, and it is rather dark.

But it does have that [Dawson's Creek][wikipedia] guy.

Worth 15 minutes? Absolutely.
