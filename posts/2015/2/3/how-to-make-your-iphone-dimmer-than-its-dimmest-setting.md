I jailbreak my iOS devices for a myriad of reasons. One big reason is so that I can use [f.lux][justgetflux].[^f] But if you are not into that, here is a nifty how-to using Accessibility features built into iOS to dim the screen beyond the lowest level.

[^f]: My wife insists I jailbreak her iOS devices as well, because she loves f.lux as much as I do! 
[^sf]: Though he never corroborated as much, it is widely held that he spearheaded the movement to bring Accessibility features to iOS. It's sad he's no longer at Apple. Though, obviously, Apple's previous 'silo' approach to their departments would never had lead to the integrated features available to iOS 8 and OS X 10.10
