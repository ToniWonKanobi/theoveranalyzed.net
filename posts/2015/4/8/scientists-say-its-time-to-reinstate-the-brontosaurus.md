Nick Stockton, for Wired:
>[Mourn] the Brontosaurus no longer! A team of heroes may have rescued it from paleontological purgatory. By cross-referencing the digitized bones from hundreds of long-necked cousins, a team of European scientists now says that they’ve identified enough unique anatomical details to reinstate the Brontosaurus at the head of its own genus.

>And if we’re lucky, good ole Pluto [might not be far behind][discovermagazine].

I remember when tomatoes [weren't a fruit][howstuffworks].
