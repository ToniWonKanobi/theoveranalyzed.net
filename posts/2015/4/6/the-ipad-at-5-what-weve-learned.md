Former Macworldian Jason Snell, writing for SuperSite for Windows:
>As much as I love using my iPad, there are times when touching a screen with a few fingers just doesn’t offer the speed and precision of a keyboard and a pointing device.

And, later:
>When I’m at my desk writing I’m using a computer with a keyboard and a pointing device

I couldn't agree more. I'm not sure that I will ever be as quick on an iPhone or iPad (even with a bluetooth keyboard) as I am on my Mac.

Finally, here is Snell wrapping things up nicely:
>[And] when I’m out and about I’ve got my phone, but when I’m in my house with the choice of all of these devices, I use my iPad and I love it.

Nothing wrong with that. Check out the rest of the post for a nice mini-history of iPad, which, in case you didn't know, celebrates its [5th anniversary this year][theoeranalyzed].

I have been using Allison's iPad and MacBook Pro for the past few days, whenever my workflow stuff got tiresome on iPhone. More or less, I continue to get by without my MacBook, and since [last writing][theoeranalyzed 2] on the subject, I am less than a week away from [April 10][cnet], which is great news.
