The one and only Dr. Drang:
> It’s common for Apple users to say they wish Apple could take over their car’s user interface because the auto manufacturers do such a bad job of it. This is typically a comment on the electronic user interface, as many cars now have a little computer screen in the center of the dashboard with poorly laid out buttons and displays. I agree and take it further: I wish Apple (or anyone who thinks carefully about design for use) **would have a go at the physical controls, too** [emphasis added].

Dr. Drang's posts [usually](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/03/slippin-and-a-slidin/) consist of long-winded pontifications on [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) topics, which is great for intelligent nerds.

However, every once in a while, he writes something that even a bonehead like me can decipher. 

This is one of those such posts.

The gist: Apple, please make a car's electronic *and* physical interface(s).[^ca]
