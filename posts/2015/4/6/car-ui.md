The one and only Dr. Drang:

> It’s common for Apple users to say they wish Apple could take over their car’s user interface because the auto manufacturers do such a bad job of it. This is typically a comment on the electronic user interface, as many cars now have a little computer screen in the center of the dashboard with poorly laid out buttons and displays. I agree and take it further: I wish Apple (or anyone who thinks carefully about design for use) **would have a go at the physical controls, too** [emphasis added].

Dr. Drang's posts [usually][1] consist of long-winded pontifications on [STEM][2] topics, which is great for intelligent nerds.

However, every once in a while, he writes something that even a bonehead like me can decipher. 

This is one of those such posts.

The gist: Apple, please make a car's electronic *and* physical interface(s).[^1]

[^1]: Perhaps an entire [car][a]?
