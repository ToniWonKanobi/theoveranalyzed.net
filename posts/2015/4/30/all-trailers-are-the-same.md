I thought about posting a recent [upload][1] by [The Verge][2], in which the entire history of the [Marvel Cinematic Universe][3] (MCU) was laid out. I was going to make fun of the Marvel franchise, and compare its giddy want for destruction with the more dreary and dark feel of the [Christopher Nolan DC efforts][4].

But then I saw this video. And I was reminded how almost *all* of the popular [superhero] movies everyone fancies aren't crazy: they're [just plain stupid][5][^1]

[^1]: [Age of Ultron][a], anyone?
