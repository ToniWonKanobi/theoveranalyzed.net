I thought about posting a recent [upload][youtube] by [The Verge][theverge], in which the entire history of the [Marvel Cinematic Universe][wikipedia] (MCU) was laid out. I was going to make fun of the Marvel franchise, and compare its giddy want for destruction with the more dreary and dark feel of the [Christopher Nolan DC efforts][dccomics].

But then I saw this video. And I was reminded how almost *all* of the popular [superhero] movies everyone fancies aren't crazy: they're [just plain stupid][youtube 2][^js]
