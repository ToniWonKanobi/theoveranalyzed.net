Reece:

> You know what else makes a long article easier to read? Fewer footnotes.

> This trend of footnotes in blog posts is out of control. Maybe a couple footnotes work well in a very long Daring Fireball essay, **but in recent years bloggers are using footnotes everywhere in places where they‚Äôre just not necessary** [emphasis added]. They‚Äôre distracting and take you out of the story.

Guilty as charged üòÅ

For the longest time, footnotes were my blogging [white whale][2]. I remember seeing them on some of Marco‚Äôs posts and thinking, ‚ÄúMan, I really want to do that.‚Äù

I had been following Marco and Gruber (among other bloggers) for some time, and noticed just how different the reading experience could be depending on footnotes. Gruber used regular old "[Web 1.0][3]" [linky][4] footnotes, while Marco was using these [fancy popup footnotes][5]. I preferred the way Marco implemented them because it allowed me to read them in-place, without having to jump around the page while doing so.  

When I first started out, I thought it would be impossible for me to do that, since Squarespace didn‚Äôt allow such a thing in their post editor. And [once I figured out][6], I couldn‚Äôt get enough. I used (use) them all the time. Admittedly, I probably use them *too* much. 

And Reece makes a good point: if they are being used so much as to distract the reader, the author is doing something wrong.

If I look back at some of my posts, I‚Äôm sure I could find evidence of all the above examples. It‚Äôs like getting a new [fast] car after having driven a not so new [or fast] one for a long time. Don‚Äôt you think it would be hard to *not* use the heck out of that new [fast] GT3 after put-put‚Äôing around with a Honda Civic for all of your 20‚Äôs? Wouldn‚Äôt it be hard to *not* drive at 100% all the time? Of course it would be hard.

Thankfully, the ‚Äònew fast car‚Äô novelty eventually wears off, and then the new GT3 owner might only drive erratically *some* of the time. The same is true for bloggers. I think I have found a happy medium in my writing. Unlike Reece (and [John Siracusa][7]), I find that footnotes in my writing---especially the Bigfoot kind---help rather than hurt. So I will continue to use them.
