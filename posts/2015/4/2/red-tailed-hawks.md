I started writing this post before I finished watching the clip. I was going to lambast legislative bureaucracy for all its horribleness, because, well, bureaucracy is lame. 

But then I finished the video. It inspired me to do what the producers of Last Week Tonight did: take that story and turn it into something positive. 

In case you weren't already aware, [red-tailed hawks][wikipedia] really are as effing [BA][urbandictionary] as John Oliver makes it sound. If you live in North America, and you observe a large raptor in the sky or on the side of the road, it is probably a red-tailed hawk.

Whenever we can, Allison and I visit our [favorite place on Earth][nps]. And while we are there, we always visit the [Teton Raptor Center][tetonraptorcenter] located in Jackson Hole Wyoming. 

TRC is a non-profit that rehabilitates injured birds of prey. As part of their mission, they offer tours and demonstrations as opportunities for education for tourists.

One of their resident raptors, Ruby, is always a sight to behold. According to Jason, TRC's resident handler, Ruby is exceptionally well suited to her new role as an educator [following her injury years ago][tetonraptorcenter 2]. Allison and I visited the center before it was officially open, mid 2009. We were privy to an extended tour, one that we have not gotten to repeat since that first visit. Jason always vaguely recognizes us when we visit, which is crazy considering the volume of tourists he sees. He is an exceptionally nice guy, and his presentations are a real treat. 

While the New Hampshire legislature *did* miss an excellent opportunity to show children just how much of a difference they can make in their government, all is not lost. The red-tailed hawk is still as awesome as it always has been. And that's not likely to ever change.
