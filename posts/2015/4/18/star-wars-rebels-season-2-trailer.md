While Season 1 was [great][theoeranalyzed], it did have some slow parts. It's almost as if the season was intentionally slowed down just to make it last 13 episodes. This is not unlike the plot of [another popular show][vox] you might have heard of. This new season's trailer-plot sure seems to suggest that this one will have a much quicker pace.
