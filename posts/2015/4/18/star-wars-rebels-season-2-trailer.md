While Season 1 was [great](@@SiteRoot@@/2015/3/3/sarah-michelle-gellar-star-wars-rebels-casting-announced), it did have some slow parts -- almost as if it was intentionally slowed down just to stretch out the season. This is not unlike the plot of [another popular show](http://www.vox.com/2015/4/16/8426921/game-of-thrones-adaptation/in/8156066) you might have heard of. This new season's trailer-plot sure seems to suggest that this one will have a much quicker pace.
