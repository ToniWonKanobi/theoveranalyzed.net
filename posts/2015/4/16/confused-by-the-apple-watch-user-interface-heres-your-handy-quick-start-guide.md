Last week, I spent a few minutes in the Apple Store [trying on the various Apple Watches][theoveranalyzed]. 

I assume most people's Apple Watch experience included some amount of playing with the user interface. I made a conscious effort to avoid doing just that, because whenever I get a new device, the most fun I have with it occurs during the first week of usage, when I get to discover all the ways I can interact with the device. I didn't want to ruin the fun I will have when I actually take delivery of the Watch, in June.

The picture above is a nice primer for June.
