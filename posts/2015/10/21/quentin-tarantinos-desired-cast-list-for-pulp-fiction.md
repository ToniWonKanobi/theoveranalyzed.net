Jason Kottke, commenting on the original post by [Open Culture][1]:

> Quentin Tarantino is the type of writer/director who writes roles in movies with specific actors in mind. For Pulp Fiction, he wanted Harvey Keitel to play Winston Wolf, Tim Roth to play Pumpkin, and Ving Rhames to play Marcellus Wallace. But he also wanted Michael Madsen to play Vincent (with Travolta as a strong second choice), John Cusack to play Lance, Matt Dillon to play Butch, and Laurence Fishburne to play Jules. Another possibility for Jules was Eddie Murphy, and Tarantino also specified "No Rappers" for that role. Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman weren't even listed for their respective roles. Gary Oldman, Nicholas Cage, Johnny Depp, and Alec Baldwin were considered for several roles but ultimately didn't appear in the film.

It's a pretty interesting list. I can't imagine anyone else but Samuel Jackson playing [Jules][2] anymore than I can imagine John Cusack playing [Lance][3].
