Michael Ausiello, for TVLine: 
>Sources confirm that Netflix has closed a deal with Warner Bros. for a limited-series revival of Gilmore Girls penned by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and exec producer Daniel Palladino.
>Although negotiations with the cast are only now beginning, I’m told all of the major players — most notably Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Kelly Bishop and Scott Patterson — are expected back for the continuation. Additionally, per multiple insiders, the revival will consist of four 90-minute episodes/mini-movies.

Gilmore Girls fans will know that the entire cast assembled a [few months back][tvline] for the ATX TV Festival. Many fans, in addition to castmembers themselves, believed the show ended poorly, following creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's departure before the last season.

More from Ausiello:
>[Sherman-Palladino] conceded that the events of the show’s final seventh season didn’t match up with the end game she envisioned for Lorelai, Rory & Co. “I haven’t [actually] seen the last season,” she said at the time, “but I heard about it from other people.”

[Agreed][theoveranalyzed].

[Netflix is the perfect conduit][marvel] for such a beloved reunion and obvious fan-service. None of the other networks could consider ("could afford") to take on a short-run, four-episode series like Netflix can.

The most important question?

"When?"

I'll update this post when I know the answer.
