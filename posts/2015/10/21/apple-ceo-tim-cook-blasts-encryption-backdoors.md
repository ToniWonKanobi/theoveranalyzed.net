David Kravets, for Ars Technica:

> "We said no backdoor is a must," Cook said at the Laguna Beach, California conference. "Do we want our nation to be secure? Of course. No one should have to decide between privacy or security. **We should be smart enough to do both** [emphasis added]. Both of these things are essentially part of the Constitution."

Bravo, [Tim][theoveranalyzed].

More from Kravets:

> NSA Director Mike Rogers also spoke, saying that the future "is all about how do we create an environment where we can build partnerships that spans the public and private sectors."
>
> He said that "strong encryption is in our nation's best interest."
>
> He was asked whether that meant impenetrable encryption. "That's not what I said, strong encryption is in our nation's best interests," he said.
>
> Rogers said a cyberattack against critical infrastructure was "only a matter of time."
