Bernie Sanders is about as [polarizing of a political figure][1] as any of the other [current][2] [front-runners][3] for [POTUS][4] [2016][5].

And if landing pages are any indication of candidates' potential presidential prowess, Bernie has a leg up on the competition.[^1][^2]

As [Naomie Ross][7] relates, Bernie's `Bernie` title font is a slightly-tweaked [Jubilat][8], and the subtext in most places is of the [Freight Sans][9] family---both fairly [popular][10] typefaces available via Adobe's TypeKit [web]font foundry.

[^2]: Trump's generic [Gotham][d]-esque logo---subtle [drop-shadow][e] included---no doubt meant to imbue raw Americanism in its most carnal state:
