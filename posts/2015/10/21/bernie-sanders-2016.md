Bernie Sanders is about as [polarizing of a political figure][youtube] as any of the other [current][hillaryclinton] [front-runners][donaldjtrump] for [POTUS][twitter] [2016][wikipedia].

And if landing pages are any indication of candidates' potential presidential prowess, Bernie has a leg up on the competition.[^oh_hil][^oh_don]

As [Naomie Ross][fontsinuse] relates, Bernie's `Bernie` title font is a slightly-tweaked [Jubilat][typekit], and the subtext in most places is of the [Freight Sans][typekit 2] family---both fairly [popular][stratechery] typefaces available via Adobe's TypeKit [web]font foundry.

[^oh_hil]: Hilary's [oft-maligned][slate] [FedEx][theoveranalyzed]-ripoff logo:
![Hilary's campaign logo][d]
[^oh_don]: Trump's generic [Gotham][typography]-esque logo---subtle [drop-shadow][wikipedia 2] included---no doubt meant to imbue raw Americanism in its most carnal state:
![Trump's campaign logo][d 2]
