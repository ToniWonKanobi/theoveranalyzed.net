Description: Finding iTunes artwork using Google Images is painful and slow. There's a better tool for that, and I've been using it for years.

Sometime halfway through dental school, a friend turned me on to the world of digital movies and the ol' `.mkv` container. I spent the better part of 6 months continually perfecting my iTunes media collection---all pirated---using applications like [Subler][2] to remux the `.mkv`'s into `.m4v`'s with artwork and metadata.

At the time, I had it in my head that doing it this way would yield better results than what I could get from the iTunes Store. Truly, though, there are few situations when 20 Mbps bitrate translates to a  significantly better encode than 8 Mbps.

Even [Don Melton][3]---the guy whose [Handbrake-powered scripts][4] have become the *de facto* standard for transcoding hard copy content to digital---even he would [agree][5] that sourcing digital media through iTunes is not only the easiest way to obtain digital media, it might as well be the standard bearer for quality encodes:

> Before using transcode-video.sh or any manual transcoding system, consider these four alternatives:
>
>	1. Buy or rent videos from online services like Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc. Check "[Can I Stream.It?][6]" to see if what you want to watch is available.
>		* Upside: Often cheaper than buying physical media like Blu-ray Discs and DVDs.
>		* Upside: Much easier to store and catalog than physical media.
>		* Upside: Usually playable on mobile devices.

I came to agree with Don Melton sometime after finishing school and after I [started working][7]. Since then, the iTunes Store has been my go-to for digital media. Instead of worrying about source of the pirated `.mkv`, it's a whole lot easier and quicker to just buy it on iTunes. More importantly, though: it is the right thing to do.

I made a promise to myself that once I was making money instead of [borrowing it from the government][8], I would make a genuine effort to quit [torrenting][9]/downloading digital media and start paying for it instead.

So in a moment of self-righteous fervor several months ago, I purged <s>all</s>most all[^1] of the pirated content in my iTunes library (~200 movies, ~20 TV series, and lots of albums) and <s>re</s>purchased many of the must-have [titles][10] I had before the purge.[^2] There are a lot I have left to re-purchase, but I can do that little by little over the rest of my life.

Why tell this story? Because every once in a while, I can't find what I want on the iTunes Store. Or, even when I can find it on the Store, I'm not happy with the metadata.

Specifically, I sometimes wish movies and music albums had different artwork.[^3] That's where Ben Dodson comes in. I stumbled on his website a few years back, and it is the absolute best place to find artwork for everything in the iTunes Store, be it apps, music, movies, TV Shows---you name it. If I decide that I don't like the artwork iTunes has for a particular album, I can just go to Dodson's site, search for the album in question, and then apply that to the files from within the iTunes browser.

![Searching is super easy. (Even when the results lead to the occasional terribly-curated choice of artwork.][11]

Although Dodson's utility can access plenty of other media types, only iTunes music purchases are [DRM][12]-free. iTunes Movies are *not* DRM-free, so I can't really use Dodson's utility for movies and TV Shows. Still, his resource is invaluable, and it has a permanent place in my Bookmarks Bar in Safari for that very reason.

[^1]: In doing so, I also morally reconciled myself with keeping a few pirated medias. For instance, some iTunes versions of the media I wanted was less than desirable. So what did I do? I bought the less than desirable versions, deleted them, and [pirated the version I wanted][a]. I feel okay with that.
[^2]: Once I started actually paying for movies, I had to think twice when contemplating a new addition to my collection. When I was pirating movies, I wouldn't hesitate to download even the most terrible B-movie, just to have it. But [some of those][b] B-movies cost $15 on the iTunes Store. While fifteen bucks isn't exactly a large sum of money, it's certainly not chump change either---it's a long way towards a meal out to eat with Allison! (And I love going out to eat [üç¥][c])
[^3]: Consider [GoodFellas (1990)][d]. When did [this][e] terrible artwork replace this much [better][f] version? Shame on you, iTunes Store.
