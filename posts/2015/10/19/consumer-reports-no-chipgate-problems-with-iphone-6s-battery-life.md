![Apple used both Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to fab the A9 chip found in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus](https://d.pr/i/1559J+ "Chipgate")

There has been a lot of [hoopla][1] over the supposed lesser battery life and raw CPU performance of the Samsung-sourced A9 iPhone 6s' and the TSMC-sourced versions. This so-called "Chipgate" is neither the [first][2], [nor][3] [likely][4] the [last][5] "---gate" to befall the iPhone.

When I first heard about Chipgate, my first act was to follow the advice of all the bloggers and download [Rogerio Hirooka's][6] [Lirum Device Info][7] application.

The results?

`N71mAP`.

My A9 is the good one---the one manufactured by TSCM.[^1]

For those who got `N71AP`, the A9 manufactured by Samsung (the "bad" one), the results could be disconcerting to say the least.

Thankfully, Consumer Reports [looked into][8] the issue, and found there was no real-world difference between either CPU.

Here's Andrew Cunningham, reporting for Ars Technica:

> The publication ran two different tests, one that stressed cellular connectivity and one that continuously loads webpages while playing music. In both cases, **the difference between the two phones was between one and two percent** [emphasis added], the same margin that Apple provided. With the exception of the Geekbench test, our battery life tests showed roughly the same thing.

So there you have it: Samsung A9 or TSMC A9---it doesn't matter. Just use your iPhone 6s and be happy.

[^1]: Interestingly, up until today, I was somehow under the impression that I had the bad CPU. I'm not sure how I misread the `m` in the CPU code, but I did.
