>[Titanium White, Phthalo Green, Prussian Blue, Van Dyke Brown, Alizarin Crimson, Sap Green, Cad [Cadmium] Yellow, Permanent red][bobross]. Now these eight colors we'll use each and every week, for every picture that we'll do. So you don't have to go out and by 1500 different kinds of colors, brushes. **You need very little equipment to paint with this** [emphasis added].

That last bit---that was Bob Ross's message from the beginning: *anyone* can paint.

Decades of paintings later, not *everyone* can paint. But I have yet to cross paths with another person who didn't enjoy watching Bob Ross do his thing.

I had no idea that Bob Ross had a [YouTube channel][youtube]. (Insta-subscribe.) Did some quick browsing this morning, and I found [one I remember watching years ago][youtube 2].
