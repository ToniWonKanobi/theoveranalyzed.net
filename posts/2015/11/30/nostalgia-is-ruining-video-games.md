Mark Hill, for The Atlantic:

> It’s by now fairly common knowledge how powerful nostalgia is as a marketing tool, but with video games, there’s another component that makes players more likely to stick with what they know and love. For many, it comes down to time: It’s one thing to watch a 90-minute movie, but squeezing a 30-hour fantasy epic into your schedule is a serious commitment. It’s a bit like taking on a new TV show, but it’s easy to fit an episode or two into an evening, whereas gameplay tends to be less structured. As a result, [about 90 percent][cnn] of people who start a game won’t finish it. And because the average gamer is aging alongside the industry ([the typical player is 37 years old][cnn 2]), he or she will tend to be mid-career, perhaps with a family. In other words, with more responsibilities and less time to form an emotional connection with a new game.

With less time for said ~37-year-olds to spend with their [peculiar][destructoid] hobby, it makes sense they'd want to spend those precious moments with a sure bet. That means *Halo 5* instead of, say, *The Order: 1886*, as Hill notes (according to [GearNuke][gearnuke]).

Because of this reality, "[risk-aversion is the new norm][wired]," says Hill.

I haven't played video games in years. And while thats something not likely to change in the near future, I will readily admit my nostalgia for those [days of old][theoveranalyzed].

I suppose there's nothing wrong with living in the past. After all, [most][theoveranalyzed 2] [old things][theoveranalyzed 3] are [better than][theoveranalyzed 4] [new things][theoveranalyzed 5].
