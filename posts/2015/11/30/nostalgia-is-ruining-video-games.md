Mark Hill, for The Atlantic:

> It’s by now fairly common knowledge how powerful nostalgia is as a marketing tool, but with video games, there’s another component that makes players more likely to stick with what they know and love. For many, it comes down to time: It’s one thing to watch a 90-minute movie, but squeezing a 30-hour fantasy epic into your schedule is a serious commitment. It’s a bit like taking on a new TV show, but it’s easy to fit an episode or two into an evening, whereas gameplay tends to be less structured. As a result, [about 90 percent][1] of people who start a game won’t finish it. And because the average gamer is aging alongside the industry ([the typical player is 37 years old][2]), he or she will tend to be mid-career, perhaps with a family. In other words, with more responsibilities and less time to form an emotional connection with a new game.

With less time for said ~37-year-olds to spend with their [peculiar][3] hobby, it makes sense they'd want to spend those precious moments with a sure bet. That means *Halo 5* instead of, say, *The Order: 1886*, as Hill notes (according to [GearNuke][4]).

Because of this reality, "[risk-aversion is the new norm][5]," says Hill.

I haven't played video games in years. And while thats something not likely to change in the near future, I will readily admit my nostalgia for those [days of old][6].

I suppose there's nothing wrong with living in the past. After all, [most][7] [old things][8] are [better than][9] [new things][10].
