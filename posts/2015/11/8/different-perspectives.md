![Anais Nin Quote][1]

I've noticed that my life experiences have an inexplicable way of becoming *lenses* through which I view everyday events.

On a personal level: "Oh, you're probably right: **I am the one who misunderstood**."

On a social level: "It's not everyone else who's got it all wrong, **it's probably me**."

On a professional level: "That patient isn't a naturally angry person, **he's just scared**."
