Eric Slivka, for MacRumors, quoting KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo:

> First, Kuo believes Apple still has a new 4-inch iPhone in the works that "resembles an upgraded iPhone 5s". The device is said to be targeted for launch in the first half of next year and will come equipped with an A9 processor.
 
>> As there is still demand for a 4-inch iPhone, we believe Apple will upgrade this product line. Because the iPhone 5s is more popular than the iPhone 5c, we think Apple is likely to launch an upgraded iPhone 5s. We predict Apple will mass-produce this new 4-inch iPhone in 1H16 with metal casings. In order to make the current iOS 9 or next-generation iOS 10 run smoothly, Apple may adopt an A9 chip for this new phone.

I have both an iPhone 4s and an iPhone 5s that I use for testing. Without hesitation, I can say that I like those phones better than the iPhone 6 and 6s. The smaller size is much more pocketable, and I don't miss the big displays all that much. Most importantly, the older iPhones are absolutely *oozing* with '80s Japanese minimalism, svelte, and luxury. 

The newer iPhones are technological marvels, to be sure, but they don't hold a candle to the previous two generations' look and feel.

Count me in.
