In fact, one of the [intended?] perks of acquiring Newson *has* to be his intellectual property on the watch bands he created while at Ikepod -- they bear an [uncanny resemblance](@@SiteRoot@@/2015/3/5/spot-the-difference-apple-watchs-stunning-straps-look-just-like-marc-newsons-old-ones) to the rest of the Apple Watch band lineup.
