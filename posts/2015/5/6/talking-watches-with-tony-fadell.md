Benjamin Clymer sat down with Nest's ([Google's][1]) [Tony Fadell][2] to talk about watches. Fadell has some great specimens to show off, that's for sure.

The most interesting of his timepieces was the first the first one mentioned in his interview, the Ikepod HemiPode Chronograph, which was designed by Marc Newson. In case you are unfamiliar with Newson, he co-founded [Ikepod][3] in 1994, and was [swooped up by Apple][4] last year.

In fact, one of the perks of acquiring Newson *has* to be his intellectual property on the watch bands he created while at Ikepod. Afterall, they bear an [uncanny resemblance][5] to the rest of the Apple Watch band lineup.
