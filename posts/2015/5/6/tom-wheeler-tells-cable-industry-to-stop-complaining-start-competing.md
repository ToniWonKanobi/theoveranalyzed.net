Jon Brodkin for Ars Technica, quoting FCC chairman Tom Wheeler:
>"You don’t have a lot of competition, especially at the higher speeds that are increasingly important to the consumer of online video,” Wheeler said. This means there isn’t the kind of “intense and constant pressure to continue to improve” as there was in the days when DSL posed a serious threat to cable, he said.

>“More competition would be better,” Wheeler said.

>“History proves that absent competition, a predominant position in the market such as yours creates economic incentives to use that market power to protect your traditional business in a way that is ultimately harmful to consumers… Your [the big internet service providers] challenge will be to overcome the temptation to use your predominant position in broadband to protect your traditional cable business. The Internet will disrupt your existing business model. It does that to everyone.”
