Wayne Pacelle, CEO of The Humane Society of The United States:
>Our researchers reviewed the records of 10 laboratories that purchased substantial numbers of dogs from random source Class B dealers in the past and we found that all of the labs are now using fewer dogs in their experiments. This means that these facilities are not replacing randomly sourced dogs with those bred specifically for research purposes.

I've talked about animal testing [previously][theoveranalyzed], albeit briefly. Suffice it to say that over the past few years, there has been an encouraging amount of animal advocacy brought to the mainstream. And every blog, every post, and ever tweet about animal welfare helps inch us closer to the goal of an animal-friendly planet.

And, despite the sometimes depressing outlook animal advocates might fall victim to, occasionally, something good happens. This is one of those times.

Better more: I can't help but think that there's more good to come.
