Bryan Bishop of The Verge:
>A robust home battery system like Powerwall could allow owners to store that solar-generated power during the day even if they're away, and then use it to charge their vehicle at night. Batteries can absorb surplus power **and flow it back into the grid when needed** [emphasis added], evening out supply and demand, something called load shifting. But the implications for Tesla's own cars is just the beginning.

This is most interesting. Everyone helping each other during the transition from non- to renewable energy. Togetherness is a novel idea, sure. But more important than novelty? Practicality.
