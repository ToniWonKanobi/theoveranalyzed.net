Ever since 2008, when I decided that playing electric bass guitar was simply cooler than cool, [Sadowsky][1] was always the *it* manufacturer of electric bass guitars for me. And rightfully so. In the bass world, there aren't many *tones* associated with musical *eras* like is the case for our electric guitar counterparts. The '[New York sound][2],' best exemplified by [Marcus Miller][3] and [Will Lee][4], is definitely a distinguishable tone, linked to a memorable period in the history of electric bass. Players like Miller and Lee put Roger and his Brooklyn boutique bass shop on the map.

This video is but a taste of Roger's most excellent take on the "Fender Jazz bass on steroids" tone.
