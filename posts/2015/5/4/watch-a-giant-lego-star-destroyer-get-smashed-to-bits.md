Okay, one [more][1]:

> Star Wars Day is all about celebrating. And sometimes celebrating properly means building a gigantic Super Star Destroyer out of Legoâ€”and then filming it getting smashed to pieces in slow-motion. 

Note the [Bossk][2][^1] and [Piett][3] callouts. Nice.

[^1]: I assume it was Bossk. His [outfit][a] is the only one resembling the "Bounty Hunter" in the shot.
