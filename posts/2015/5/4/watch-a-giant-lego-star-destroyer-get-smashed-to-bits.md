Okay, one [more](@@SiteRoot@@/2015/5/4/mark-hamill-star-wars-screen-test):
>Star Wars Day is all about celebrating. And sometimes celebrating properly means building a gigantic Super Star Destroyer out of Legoâ€”and then filming it getting smashed to pieces in slow-motion. 

Note the [Bossk](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bossk)[^bo] and [Piett](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Firmus_Piett) callouts. Nice. 

[^bo]: I assume it was Bossk. His [outfit](http://gadgets.gunaxin.com/a-tribute-to-the-bounty-hunters-of-empire-strikes-back/56308) is the only one resembling the "Bounty Hunter" in the shot.
