Okay, one [more][theoveranalyzed]:

> Star Wars Day is all about celebrating. And sometimes celebrating properly means building a gigantic Super Star Destroyer out of Legoâ€”and then filming it getting smashed to pieces in slow-motion.

[^bo]: I assume it was Bossk. His [outfit][gunaxin] is the only one resembling the "Bounty Hunter" in the shot.
