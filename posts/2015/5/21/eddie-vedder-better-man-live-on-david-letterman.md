A fitting performance,[^1] and a special [tribute][1] to a years-long relationship between the grunge band and Dave.

PS: Sorry for the lack of posts lately. I have been busy getting TheOverAnalyzed 3.0 ready to go. Should be ready within the week. I only took a break because Dave's *last night* was last night.

[^1]: Am I the only one who thought Will and Paul's shared bass entrance at the beginning of the song was somewhat fumbled?
