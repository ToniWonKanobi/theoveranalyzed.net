Russ Fischer of /Film on the Star Wars: The Force Awakens panel at Comic Con 2015:

> [Director] J.J. Abrams and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy did not arrive empty-handed. In addition to a roster of cast and crew, the two brought a behind the scenes reel that ran a few minutes.

The official Star Wars twitter shared as much last night:

Via voiceover, Mark Hamill:

> Real sets. Practical Effects. You've been here, but you don't know *this* story. Nothing's changed, really. I mean everything's changed, but nothing's changed. That's the way you want it to be, really. To see the way the technology has evolved. And yet, keeping one foot in the pre-digital world. 

And Carrie Fisher:

> It couldn't be more exciting. It's still surreal.

This is going to be amazing.
