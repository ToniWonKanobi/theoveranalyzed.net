While not an initial success at the [box office][bo], [Brad Bird][bb]'s 1999 animated feature has stood the test of time, becoming somewhat of a [cult classic][cc] in the years since its release.

According to Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly, fans will have a little something extra to celebrate this fall:

> [Pencil in] Sept. 30 on your calendar. Warner Bros. and Fathom Events are putting a remastered ‚ÄúSignature Edition‚Äù version of The Iron Giant in theaters for a very limited engagement. The special-event screening will take place at 7:00 p.m. on Sept. 30, with an encore showing on Oct. 4 at 12 p.m. in participating theaters around the country. The new remastered cut will include two all-new scenes.

Bird himself owned the scoop:

<blockquote lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A cool new poster for an old friend.&#10;See <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheIronGiant?src=hash">#TheIronGiant</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SDCC?src=hash">#SDCC</a> &amp; learn more about the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SignatureEdition?src=hash">#SignatureEdition</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rerelease?src=hash">#rerelease</a> <a href="http://t.co/iPmXQZ3Fyn">pic.twitter.com/iPmXQZ3Fyn</a></p>&mdash; Brad Bird (@BradBirdA113) <a href="https://twitter.com/BradBirdA113/status/618829026610671620">July 8, 2015</a></blockquote>

When I finished school[^yes] and started working, I toned down all of my movie piracy. I deleted almost every illegally downloaded movie except for ones [that weren't available on streaming services or otherwise legitimate sources][sw]. I recount this not to install some sense of self-worth or morality. No; instead, this: The Iron Giant was one of the first films I purchased [digitally][ig]. It was a movie I knew Allison would like, and I wanted to *own* the movie in as much of a non-ephemeral state as possible. In a time when Pixar absolutely [dominated][ts2] [[dominates][is]] the animated feature film industry, there are still a few holdout gems like The Iron Giant.

## Update: New Trailer
<p class="updateTime"><time datetime="2015-08-27">August 27, 2015</time></p>

## Update: Sequel in the Works?
<p class="updateTime"><time datetime="2015-08-30">August 30, 2015</time></p>

Ethan Anderton of [/Film][vd]:

> For those who don‚Äôt know, Vin Diesel was the voice of the titular giant robot who crash lands on Earth and befriends a young boy, making for quite the charming and unique update of the familiar E.T. The Extra Terrestrial tale. And Diesel recently took to his Facebook page to post the Signature Edition trailer, and he teased that Warner Bros. might be on the verge of making The Iron Giant 2 happen.
>
> Along with the Signature Edition trailer [...] [Diesel said][ds]:
>> ‚ÄúI have been very lucky to have played so many interesting characters‚Ä¶ one of the first and one of my favorites is‚Ä¶ the Iron Giant.
>	
>> P.s. Don‚Äôt be surprised when you hear WB announce the sequel.‚Äù

If you've seen the first movie, you'll know that the ending left plenty of room for a sequel. Still, as Anderton notes, this could just be wishful thinking for Diesel. Who knows---16 years might just be the necessary time required to inspire a sequel out of Brad Bird.

## Update: iTunes Version Automatically Includes Signature Edition
<p class="updateTime"><time datetime="2015-10-12">October 12, 2015</time></p>

[Todd Vaziri][tv] of Industrial Light & Magic fame tweeted some good news this morning. It looks like iTunes automatically includes the Signature Edition of the movie now.

<blockquote lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you previously purchased THE IRON GIANT from iTunes, you‚Äôve been automatically ‚Äòupgraded‚Äô for free. <a href="https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/653593764611538945/photo/1" title="Todd Vaziri's tweet"">pic.twitter.com/h9oCu7Dj0M</a></p>&mdash; Todd Vaziri (@tvaziri) <a href="https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/653593764611538945" title="More from Vaziri">October 12, 2015</a></blockquote>

I noticed a few weeks back that the [iTunes artwork][ita] for the movie changed, but I didn't even think to check if iTunes included the new version.
