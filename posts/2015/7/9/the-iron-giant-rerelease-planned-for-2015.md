While not an initial success at the [box office][bo], [Brad Bird][bb]'s 1999 animated feature has stood the test of time, becoming somewhat of a [cult classic][cc] in the years since its release.

According to Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly, fans will have a little something extra to celebrate this fall:
>[Pencil in] Sept. 30 on your calendar. Warner Bros. and Fathom Events are putting a remastered ‚ÄúSignature Edition‚Äù version of The Iron Giant in theaters for a very limited engagement. The special-event screening will take place at 7:00 p.m. on Sept. 30, with an encore showing on Oct. 4 at 12 p.m. in participating theaters around the country. The new remastered cut will include two all-new scenes.

Bird himself owned the scoop:

When I finished school[^yes] and started working, I toned down all of my movie piracy. I deleted almost every illegally downloaded movie except for ones [that weren't available on streaming services or otherwise legitimate sources][sw]. I recount this not to install some sense of self-worth or morality. No, instead, this: The Iron Giant was one of the first films I purchased from the [iTunes Store][ig]. It was a movie I knew Allison would like, and I wanted to *own* the movie in as much of a non-ephemeral state as possible. In a time when Pixar absolutely [dominated][ts2] [[dominates][is]] the animated feature film industry, there are still a few holdout gems like The Iron Giant.
