Jonathan Allen, writing for Vox:
>I charged a Taylor Swift ticket to my [man card][urbandictionary]. And it was worth it.

>She's a class act who puts on a great show and manages to deliver messages about self-worth and self-empowerment while touching on universal struggles that anyone can relate to, no matter their demographic. Yeah, I'm proud to call myself a Taylor Swift fan.

The other day, as I was finishing up with a patient, the subject of music came up.[^kt] My patient was a 40-something year-old male, and we shared with each other our musical preferences. Being the well-rounded music nerd that I am, I mentioned [Pearl Jam][wikipedia] and [Third Eye Blind][wikipedia 2] -- obvious favorites for the average [40-something][wikipedia 3] male, right? We also agreed on the absolute mastery of the art exhibited by Elton John in his early 70's albums such as [Tumbleweed Connection][wikipedia 4]. We talked a bit about new music too. 

Just as it always does, a discussion of *modern* pop music has to include my two cents about modern electric bass guitar. And I can't talk about bass guitar without mentioning something about Taylor Swift. 

Somewhat perplexingly, as soon as I mentioned being a fan Taylor Swift,[^ts] the conversation changed. It wasn't awkward or anything, but *after* Taylor Swift came up, my patient made it abundantly clear that my musical tastes were suspect.[^he] It is almost as if he couldn't believe that a 20-something year-old male like myself could appreciate Taylor Swift?

I suppose the notion that a guy liking a girl pop star is just, on the most superficial of levels, somewhat emasculating. I don't subscribe to that theory myself, but I think my patient did. 

And that's a real shame, because as a fan of roots-style bass guitar in pop music, I look no further than [Amos Heller][twitter], Tae's touring [bassist][youtu] [since 2007][bassguitarmagazine].

Oh well. Why does my patient [gotta be so mean][youtube]?

[^he]: He also insinuated that my professional skills must be suspect too, since I liked Taylor Swift. We ell oh ell'd together at that.
[^kt]: My J-O-B is a nice one, but I don't enjoy it *nearly* as much as I do talking about non-dental things like music, or movies, or technology.
[^ts]: More precisely, I said I would up and quit my J-O-B job for the opportunity to go play bass for her 🎸
