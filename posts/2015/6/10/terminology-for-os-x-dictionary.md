I've heard of [Terminology for iOS][1] before, but have never used it myself. This is probably because with [few exceptions][2], all my writing takes place on OS X machines. If I were [Federico Viticci][3], a dictionary app for iOS might make more sense.

Yesterday, Greg Pierce of Agile Tortiose released a version of [Terminology for OS X][4], which integrates with the built-in OS X Dictionary.app. Installation was a breeze, and I suspect my dictionary queries will be much more broadly covered than before.

Agile Tortiose is the same team that makes [Drafts][5], a power-user note-taking app for iOS. Drafts is great because it launches with a blank note and the "cursor" ready to take typing inputs from the keyboard. I have gone back and forth between Drafts and [Vesper][6] (and [Simplenote][7]) over the past few years, ultimately settling[^1] on Vesper for the [typography][8].
