I've heard of [Terminology for iOS][apple] before, but have never used it myself. This is probably because with [few exceptions][theoveranalyzed], all my writing takes place on OS X machines. If I were [Federico Viticci][macstories], a dictionary app for iOS might make more sense.

Yesterday, Greg Pierce of Agile Tortiose released a version of [Terminology for OS X][term], which integrates with the built-in OS X Dictionary.app. Installation was a breeze, and I suspect my dictionary queries will be much more broadly covered than before.
