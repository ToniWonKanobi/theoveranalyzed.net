I've heard of [Terminology for iOS][apple] before, but have never used it myself. This is probably because with [few exceptions][theoveranalyzed], all my writing takes place on OS X machines. If I were [Federico Viticci][macstories], a dictionary app for iOS might make more sense.

Yesterday, Greg Pierce of Agile Tortiose released a version of [Terminology for OS X][term], which integrates with the built-in OS X Dictionary.app. Installation was a breeze, and I suspect my dictionary queries will be much more broadly covered than before.

Agile Tortiose is the same team that makes [Drafts][dra], a power-user note-taking app for iOS. Drafts is great because it launches with a blank note and the "cursor" ready to take typing inputs from the keyboard. I have gone back and forth between Drafts and [Vesper][ves] (and [Simplenote][simp]) over the past few years, ultimately settling[^se] on Vesper for the [typography][typ].

[^se]: I'm never *truly* settled when it comes to apps.
