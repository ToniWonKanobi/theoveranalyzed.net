Over the course of the next few days (weeks?), I am going to explain how exactly I left Squarespace and transitioned to Casey Liss's static blogging engine, [Camel][github]. I am aptly calling this series [TheOverAnalyzed 3.0][tag].

I said "weeks" because it might actually take that long to finish the series. I haven't even begun to write the posts. Moreover, moving TheOverAnalyzed to Camel has taken up almost all of my free time over the past two weeks. Because of that, I'm sure I have several links saved to my "Blog Content" folder in Instapaper -- links I'm sure I'll want to share in-between these long-winded design pieces. My intent for this series to be part how-to[^for] and part web design philosophy in general.[^ph]

In addition to the loads of Tweet-learning passed to me from both [Casey Liss][twitter] and [Roger Stringer][twitter 2] (more on him later in the series), I was forced to learn a bunch of stuff the hard way. I hope this series can make a prospective Camel-rider's journey a tad bit easier than my own.

The tentative outline:

### Part I: Modifying Old Files

Making all my old Markdown files play nice with Camel was easy, but extremely time-consuming.

### Part II: Redirecting Old Links

I wanted to make sure that links shared on Twitter -- although no longer canonical -- pointed to the old content's new location.

### Part III: Modifying A Camel

Camel came with several nifty Markdown plugins, but I wanted more. 

### Part IV: Determining The Layout And Style

Second only to the time spent modifying the files, this step took the longest (and for good reason).

### Part V: Pushing To Heroku, And The Finishing Touches 

Getting the site up and running on Heroku was easy. I also had a few odds and ends to straighten out before I was finished.

In the meantime, please explore the new site! I'm pretty proud of it. And as always, thanks for reading.

[^for]:  For people who were as green as I was when I started. I didn't know GitHub from Git.
[^ph]: I could get pretty meta about the how and why of some of the things I have implemented on the site.
