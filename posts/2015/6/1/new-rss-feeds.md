One of the biggest pushes for [my move from Squarespace to Camel][theoveranalyzed] was to have an '[alternate RSS][alt]' feed, in which linked posts point back to my blog instead of their actual targets. This isn't true to Daring Fireball's original concept of a [Linked List][ll], but some people prefer that method of subscription.

[http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/rss][theoveranalyzed 2] for conventional linked posts behavior.

[http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/rss-alternate][theoveranalyzed 3] for link posts pointing back here.
