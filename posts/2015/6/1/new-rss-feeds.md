One of the reasons for [my move from Squarespace to Camel][theoveranalyzed] was to have an '[alternate RSS][alt]' feed, in which linked posts point back to my blog instead of their actual targets. This isn't true to John Gruber's original implementation of a [Linked List][ll], but some people prefer that method of subscription.
