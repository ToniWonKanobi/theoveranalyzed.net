One of the reasons for [my move from Squarespace to Camel][theoveranalyzed] was to have an ['alternate'][alt] RSS feed, for which linked posts point back to my blog instead of their actual targets. This isn't true to John Gruber's original implementation of a [Linked List][ll], but some people prefer that method of subscription.

Subscribe to standard feed: <http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/rss>

Or, subscribe to the alternate feed: <http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/rss-alternate>
