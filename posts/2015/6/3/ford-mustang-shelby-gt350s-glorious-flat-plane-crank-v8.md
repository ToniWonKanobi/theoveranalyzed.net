[A few months ago][caranddriver] we learned that Ford/Shelby had gone and done the unimaginable: they strapped a flat-plane V8 in the new GT350. No supercharger. No [slushbox][duckduckgo]. Just that glorious V8. And now we know even more.

Patrick George for Jalopnik:

> Well, this is Fordâ€™s most powerful naturally-aspirated engine, EVER, and their highest-revving V8, EVER, with a staggering redline of 8,250 RPM.

Yes, 8,250 RPM. That's like, well, unheard of in an American muscle car. The pinnacle of modern Corvette engineering[^at] was the [C6 Z06][wikipedia]'s NA [LS7][wikipedia 2], with a 7,000 RPM redline. This new beast from Henry's crew is that much better. I haven't yearned for an American car since [my Corvette days][theoveranalyzed]. I can't help but feel differently about this new GT350. No longer the quintessential 'mid-life-crisis-but-doesn't-want-or-can-afford-a-Corvette' car, the new GT350 sounds quite possibly amazing. 

[^at]: At least, in my opinion.
