Marco Arment on audiophiles:
>This is what’s so frustrating about audiophiles: they convince themselves, and others, that there’s always more sound quality to be had (and noticed) with an endless money pit of obscure components and upgrades.

I've talked about this [before][theoveranalyzed], and my opinion hasn't changed much. If anything, it's still reassuring to know that I wasn't crazy when I couldn't hear the difference between iTunes Plus-quality encodes and their 24-bit/192kHz ALAC counterparts. I agree with him: good [headphones][amazon]/speakers are the most important, and the rest is just that 'last 5%' (if that much).
