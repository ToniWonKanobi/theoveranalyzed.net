The Verge's Chris Ziegler:
>"IPHONE" doesn't look good set in all-caps, which is how the Apple Watch's logo is styled. In fact, it looks terrible. If you kill the "i," your problem is solved.

>There's no guarantee that Apple will update the phone's logo to match the Apple Watch's, of course, but it seems logical that that'd be the goal.

 tv,  Pay,  WATCH. Is  PHONE next? 

Apple has indeed been moving away from it's "i" prefix, [established][everystevejobsvideo] in the early days of Steve Jobs' Apple 2.0. However, as many have suggested, dropping the "i" in "iPhone", while in keeping with their new brand direction, would go against every businessman's instinct. Obscuring the brand image of Apple's cash cow could potentially confuse buyers and separate Apple from its previous caché that is *iPhone.*
