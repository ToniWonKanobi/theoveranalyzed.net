I've been [following][2] Frere-Jones' blog since it was [linked][3] on Daring Fireball some time ago. While I don't consider myself a font expert (not by a long shot), I do find the art and science behind this centuries-old craft very interesting. 

![Frere-Jones: "Weights, mathematically equal and optically equal"][4]

His latest post deals with font weights and how designers must occasionally disregard perfect geometric shapes in lieu of 'imperfect' ones instead. Sometimes, it's these imperfect shapes that appear more pleasing to the eye.

I've linked to Frere-Jones twice now, just in case anyone is keeping track.
