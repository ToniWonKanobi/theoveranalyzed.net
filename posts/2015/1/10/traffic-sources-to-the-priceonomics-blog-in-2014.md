John Gruber recently [linked][daringfireball] to an [article][priceonomics] from Pricenomics regarding traffic to its blog. Here's a quote Gruber selected:

> One thing we gradually noticed, however, was that maintaining a Facebook page was pretty much a waste of time by the end of 2014

In case anyone wondered why this site has no social media presence on Facebook, it is because Facebook is a waste of time and completely irrelevant.

[From [John Gruber][daringfireball]]

### Update: Facebook, After All

Since the end of May of 2015, [TheOverAnalyzed is on Facebook][facebook]. It's basically an automated account. But if Ben Thompson thinks it's worth it, I should too.
