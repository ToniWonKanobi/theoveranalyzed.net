Marco Arment on Overcast's financials:
>I’m probably coming in under what I could get at a good full-time job in the city, but I don’t have to actually work for someone else on something I don’t care about. I can work in my nice home office, drink my fussy coffee, take a nap after lunch if I want to, and be present for my family as my kid grows up. That’s my definition of success.

This is every Apple nerd's dream. Scratch that. This is more than that. This is every *person*'s dream when they are working for the man. Nobody wants to be beholden to an employer. Nobody wants to be told when to come in to work, day in and day out. We want to be free. Our tendencies and natural affinity for routine (and hatred of change) makes us complacent. Heck, I'm sure some people even *appreciate* the monotony of drudgingly going to work, and working for a boss. 

But how great would it be to be your own boss? Make your own schedule? Want to "take a nap," as Marco mentioned? Take one. Nice.

It just so happens Marco's own version of living the dream involves building applications that are beloved by the Apple community, which is neat if you're into that sort of thing (I am into that sort of thing).

He's his own boss. A self-employed super nerd. 🏡 = 🏢 = 👊 = 😎
