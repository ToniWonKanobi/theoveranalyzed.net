This isn't going to be easy. As of late, I have been toying with consolidating my current setup into a more svelte state of being, one with only an iPhone and either a MacBook Air, or an iPad Air 2. Both the [MBA][anandtech] and the [Air 2][toolsandtoys] have been well-regarded. One thing is for sure: German's work here makes me want to wait another 6 months before finalizing my decision.
