>It blows my mind that Android OEMs canâ€™t get this right.

In early 2013, [I left iPhone][instagram]. I know. It's crazy. But at the time, the purest Android smartphone out there, the [Nexus 4][m], was calling my name. The allure of an open canvas operating system was enticing. Truly, [Jelly Bean][m 2] was a great release. 

But do you know what made me come back? The [apps sucking terribly][blogspot] on Android, and, to a certain extent, the [crappy camera][theverge] on the Nexus 4. 

My Android adventure, as short lived as it was, worked wonders for my insecurities with iOS. No matter what the pundits say, iPhone has always had the best camera for the most people. 

[I came running back][instagram 2], and I can't see myself ever leaving againðŸ“±
