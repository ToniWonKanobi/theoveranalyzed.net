I have [previously eluded][1] to my Apple Hardware Bucket List. However, I have yet to publicly define it.

Here it is, in more or less chronological order:

* Macintosh [(128K)][2]/[512K][3]/[Plus][4]/[SE][5]/[Classic][6]
* [iMac G3][7]
* [iMac G4][8]
* [Power Mac G4 Cube][9]
* iPod ([3rd Generation][10])
* iPhone ([1st Generation][11])
* iPad ([1st Generation][12])

Tags are not publicly exposed on TheOverAnalyzed, but you could make nifty use of URL slugs for posts tagged [Apple Hardware Bucket List][13].
