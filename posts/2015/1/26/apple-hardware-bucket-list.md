I have [previously eluded](/2015/1/14/this-imac-concept-is-ridiculous-in-the-best-possible-way) to my Apple Hardware Bucket List.[^ahbl] However, I have yet to publicly define it.

Here it is, in more or less chronological order:

* Macintosh [(128K)][f]/[512K][s]/[Plus][t]/[SE][fo]/[Classic][fi]
* [iMac G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3)
* [iMac G4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4)
* [Power Mac G4 Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube)
* iPod ([3rd Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Classic#3rd_generation))
* iPhone ([1st Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_(1st_generation)))
* iPad ([1st Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(1st_generation)))

Tags are not publicly exposed on TheOverAnalyzed, but you could make nifty use of URL slugs for posts tagged [AHBL](/tags/AHBL).
