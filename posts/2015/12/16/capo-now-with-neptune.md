From the Capo website:

> Capo and Capo touch now include isolation controls, powered by SuperMegaUltraGroovy's all-new audio isolation engine called Neptune. With just a few adjustments, vocals or instruments can be heard in isolation or muted in your music.

It isn't often that I can't learn a bass part by ear. And most of the time, if I can't do it by ear alone, I can always check for a chord sheet online.[^1] Most of the music I play live is worship music, which is pretty forgiving as far as the bass line is concerned. I usually listen to what the bassist is doing on the track, and then do my own version when I play live.

There are times, however, when I have to learn the *exact* bass part from the track. That's sometimes harder to do by ear and with just a chord sheet.

Enter Capo.

I haven't used Capo a lot, but over the years, when I have used it, it's been *extremely* helpful in learning a part. I remember having to learn the Switchfoot song "[Redemption][1]" a few months ago. Yeah, I probably could have figured it out by ear eventually, but that would have taken a lot longer than it took me with Capo.

Capo was always pretty simple to use:

1. Load the song file[^2]
2. Isolate bass and/or reduce vocals, etc.
3. Learn the song
4. Done.

Capo's isolation was *quite* effective before. 

Now, with Neptune, it seems even better:

> When enabled, adjustments to the panning slider allow you to find the sound source that you're chasing. Tweaks to the width and frequency range help you zero in on the sound.

Bravo, Capo.

Bucking [the recent trend][2], you can purchase Capo [here][3]. So go get it.

[^1]: Yes, they usually suck, but in a pinch, they can really help.
[^2]: Sorry Apple Music-ers and iTunes Matchers---Capo needs an actual file (not a stream file).
