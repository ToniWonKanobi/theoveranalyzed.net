![Upside-down flag emoji][1]

You know that flag emoji (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) from a [couple posts ago][2]?

Wonder how I got it to rotate like the House of Cards [graphic][3]?

Easy. [CSS3][4]!

1. I wrapped the flag emoji (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)  in a `<span>` tag and applied an inline style rule[^1]
2. Next, I used the CSS3 property `transform`[^2]  with the `rotate: ();` value like so:
	
	```css
	transform: rotate(-180deg);
	```

3. This didn't work.

	The result for the following markup
	
	```html
	I know who I'm voting for <span style="transform: rotate(-180deg);">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span>
	```
	
	was
	
	<mark class="red">I know who I'm voting for ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</mark>
	
	**The flag wasn't upside-down as I had hoped.**
	
	What was the problem?
	
4. Turns Out&trade; I needed to force the desired-text-to-be-rotated to `inline-block` (or `block`), because `<span>` is, by definition, an inline element

	It's wonky to expect the flag emoji (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) to rotate when it's still the child of a `<p>` that is *not* styled to rotate.
	
5. So, I applied the `display` property with the value `inline-block` and added it to the markup like so

	```html
	I know who I'm voting for <span style="display: inline-block; transform: rotate(-180deg);">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span>
	```
	
	resulting in
	
	<mark class="green">I know who I'm voting for <span style="display: inline-block; transform: rotate(-180deg);">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span></mark>

[^1]: I did this because it's not worth adding a custom class to my [main stylesheet][a] just for this one random style change.
[^2]: Technically, I should have used the `-webkit` prefix ala `-webkit-transform`, but I'm lazy, and I'm pretty sure the `transform` property has been adopted by most every browser that matters. So why add additional prefix cruft when it's more or less unnecessary?
