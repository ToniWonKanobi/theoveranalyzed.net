[Kyle Kallgren][1]:

> Star Wars succeeded because of its roots in film history and mythology, and its influence over generations of filmmakers can be felt in countless works that came after it. For better or worse, Star Wars engulfs the past and future of moviemaking.

So, Star Wars is simultaneously derivative *and* original 👌🏿
