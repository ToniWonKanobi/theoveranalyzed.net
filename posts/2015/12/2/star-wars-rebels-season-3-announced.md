Peter Sciretta for /Film:

> Disney XD has ordered a third season of its animated series “Star Wars Rebels” from Lucasfilm. The third season is currently in production and scheduled to premiere in 2016.

[Sounds][2] [good][3] [to][4] [me][5].

That said, Star Wars Rebels *can't* last forever, as Scrietta notes:

> We heard from a very good source last year that Star Wars Rebels [would last only three or four seasons][6] before Disney launched a whole new Star Wars animated series, with all new characters, set in the timeline of the current movies (the Star Wars sequel trilogy).

Everyone knows what happens after Rebels: [Star Wars][7] happens. There's really only so much story to be had in the in-between Episodes III and IV. Moreover, I'm sure Rebels creator [Dave Filoni][8] doesn't want his latest effort to suffer the same overly long and drawn-out life that his other series was forced to endure.

Despite it being a TV series aimed at children and young adults, I've enjoyed Star Wars Rebels quite a bit. Yes, there have been times (like right now in the midst of Season 2) where the plot seemed to really stagnate: no character development, no Clone Wars fan-service, and no Darth Vader. But overall, the series has been a noble effort from Filoni and the rest of the team. This is the first 'new' thing from Star Wars that didn't invariably [suck][9].
