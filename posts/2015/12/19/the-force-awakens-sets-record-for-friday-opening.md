![Star Wars The Force Awakens][1]

Dante D'Orazio, for The Verge:

> The Force Awakens â€” to the surprise of no one â€” is a force to be reckoned with at the box office. The latest numbers are in, and the latest Star Wars has set the record for the biggest Friday of all time, raking in an estimated $120.5 million in North America on its opening day. Thursday night previews also broke previous records by hauling in $57 million.

[No][2] surprise here.

As you might expect, I have plenty of thoughts on the movie. However, I don't want to share them *at least* until opening weekend is in the bag. (All of my family and most of my friends haven't yet seen it.)[^1]

 ### Update: <i>The Force Awakens</i> Kills It

Ethan Anderton, for [/Film][3]:

> Experts have been analyzing and predicting the box office performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens for months, but now we have hard numbers that give the sci-fi sequel the biggest domestic box office opening of all time. Thatâ€™s just one of the records that The Force Awakens box office numbers smashed into oblivion, and it seems bound to potentially smash a few more as well. Get the details below!
>
> In its opening weekend, Star Wars: The Force Awakens raked in $238 million in the United States, putting it well ahead of this yearâ€™s record-setting $208.8 million opening weekend from Jurassic World. Worldwide the film has pulled in $517 million total, putting it just shy of Jurassic Worldâ€˜s $524 million. However, the numbers for The Force Awakens may not all be in yet, and it wouldnâ€™t be hard for the movie to get pushed over that record by the time the weekend is over.

I'm on track to see it again within the next couple weeks (possibly three times total, if Allison obliges).

It's that good.

</aside>

[^1]: The situation at home is particularly precarious because Allison *insists* on asking questions surrounding pivotal characters. And, despite my best intentions, I fear I couldn't answer any of those questions without possibly letting a spoiler slip.
	<p>If ever there were a movie containing a spoiler one should absolutely avoid at all costs, <i>The Force Awakens</i> would be it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="Wikipedia: The Empire Strikes Back">this one</a> not withstanding).
