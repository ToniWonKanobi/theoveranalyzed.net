![Star Wars The Force Awakens][1]

Dante D'Orazio, for The Verge:

> The Force Awakens â€” to the surprise of no one â€” is a force to be reckoned with at the box office. The latest numbers are in, and the latest Star Wars has set the record for the biggest Friday of all time, raking in an estimated $120.5 million in North America on its opening day. Thursday night previews also broke previous records by hauling in $57 million.

[No][2] surprise here.

As you might expect, I have plenty of thoughts on the movie. However, I don't want to share them *at least* until opening weekend is in the bag. (All of my family and most of my friends haven't yet seen it.)[^1]

[^1]: The situation at home is particularly precarious because Allison *insists* on asking questions surrounding pivotal characters. And, despite my best intentions, I fear I couldn't answer any of those questions without possibly letting a spoiler slip.
	<p>If ever there were a movie containing a spoiler one should absolutely avoid at all costs, <i>The Force Awakens</i> would be it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="Wikipedia: The Empire Strikes Back">this one</a> not withstanding).
