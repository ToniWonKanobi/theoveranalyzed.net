![Pixar Themes Chart][1]

Caroline Framke and Javier Zarracina of Vox:

> It came as no surprise. The best moments in Pixar's history prize whimsy, imagination, and an open-hearted earnestness. (And then there's Cars.)

Interesting chart.

(And while I didn't hate [Cars][2] as much as everyone else, I can understand the sentiment.)
