![Donald Trump][1]

[Another][2] piece from The Verge, this time by Colin Lecher:

> It's unclear if the domain — a $250,000 destination that Bush [reportedly declined to register][3] earlier in the campaign, opting for [jeb2016.com][4] instead — was purchased by the Trump campaign directly or merely supporters, but it's an embarrassing faux pas for Bush, who has [occasionally struggled][5] with forays into the digital world.

[Say what you will][6] about Trump---this is pure internet-awesome.
