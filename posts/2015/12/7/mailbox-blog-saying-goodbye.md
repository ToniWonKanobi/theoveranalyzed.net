![Goodbye, Mailbox][files]

Surprise, surprise.

[Another][archive] [great][wikipedia] email app goes the way of the dodo.

While I've since switched to [Airmail][apple] on OS X, Mailbox for iOS hasn't left my Dock on since its [release in 2013][dropbox].

I've been on the TestFlight for Airmail's iPhone app for a few months, and sadly, I don't think it will be anywhere near as great as Mailbox.

Admittedly, developing email clients is hard work. Because email existed before web standards, there are *so* many distinct protocols to support---IMAP, POP (yes, still), Gmail---the list goes on.

So it's not like writing an email app is as easy as, say, a notes app.

Still, I can't help feel that the App Store marketplace is wide open for a simple yet powerful email client.

Here's hoping.
