![Goodbye, Mailbox][files]

From the Mailbox blog:

> [As] we deepened our focus on collaboration, we realized there’s only so much an email app can do to fundamentally fix email. We’ve come to believe that the best way for us to improve people’s productivity going forward is to streamline the workflows that generate so much email in the first place.

Surprise, surprise?

[Another][archive] [great][wikipedia] email app goes the way of the dodo.

While I've since switched to [Airmail][apple] on OS X, Mailbox for iOS hasn't left my Dock on since its [release in 2013][dropbox].

I've been on the TestFlight for Airmail's iPhone app for a few months, and sadly, I don't think it will be anywhere near as great as Mailbox.

Admittedly, developing email clients is hard work. Because email existed before web standards, there are *so* many distinct protocols to support---IMAP, POP (yes, still), Gmail---the list goes on.

So it's not like writing an email app is as easy as, say, a notes app.

Still, I can't help feel that the App Store marketplace is wide open for a simple yet powerful email client.

Here's hoping.

 ### Update: Brent Simmons on Mailbox's Shuttering
<p class="updateTime"><time datetime="2015-12-07">December 12, 2015</time></p>

Brent Simmons shared his thoughts on the matter:

> You can’t go by size of company, because big companies like Google or Apple will retire apps, and small companies will fail — or switch their attention to the app that makes them money but isn’t the one you use.

> Getting acquired may be the thing that keeps an app alive, or it might be the thing that kills it. Or it might keep an app alive just a little while longer.
>
> In other words: just going by acquired-or-not isn’t actually useful.

He's right: getting acquired doesn't necessarily mean that a community-beloved product/service/(app) will get shut down.

My contention is that for third-party iOS email clients specifically---that has all too often been the case.
