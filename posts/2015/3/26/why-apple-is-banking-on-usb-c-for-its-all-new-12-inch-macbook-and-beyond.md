Roger Fingas of AppleInsider:
>USB-C supports something called the “DisplayPort Alternate Mode,” which allows native DisplayPort signals to be carried over one, two, or four lanes as needed, with the tradeoff that using all four lanes will **reduce USB 3.1 functions to the 2.0 level** [emphasis added], and that USB-C can’t handle Dual-Mode Display Port, and hence passive (as opposed to active) DisplayPort adapters.

There is still a lot we don’t know about the new MacBook and it’s USB-C port. Most importantly, we don’t know what the implications of which in regards to peripheral support:

1. Will the new MacBook be able to drive a 4K display at 60 Hz? 
	* I spoke with an Apple representative, and he was not able to give me a definitive answer
		* The [specs][apple] page is no help
2. If so, will it 'reduce' the bandwidth of data transfers to ~USB 2.0 speeds, like Fingas alludes?

[April 10][cnet] can't come soon enough.

## Update: No 4K for MacBook
<p class="updateTime"><time datetime="2015-04-11">April 11, 2015</time></p>

Weeks ago, I called Apple and asked them about the refresh rate of greater-than-1080p displays. At the time, they didn't have any more info than what was on this [page][apples].

I was checking into things this morning, and saw this:
>The MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015) will support these displays and rates using the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter.

* 3840x2160 at 30 Hz refresh rate
* 4096x2160 at 24 Hz refresh rate (mirroring is not supported at this resolution)

I'm not sure when that info was added, but the page was last updated yesterday.

**So, no 4K @ 60 Hz for the new MacBook it seems.**
