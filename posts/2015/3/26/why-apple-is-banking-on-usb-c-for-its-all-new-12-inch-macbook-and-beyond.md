Roger Fingas of AppleInsider:
>USB-C supports something called the “DisplayPort Alternate Mode,” which allows native DisplayPort signals to be carried over one, two, or four lanes as needed, with the tradeoff that using all four lanes will **reduce USB 3.1 functions to the 2.0 level** [emphasis added], and that USB-C can’t handle Dual-Mode Display Port, and hence passive (as opposed to active) DisplayPort adapters.

There is still a lot we don’t know about the new MacBook and it’s USB-C port. Most importantly, we don’t know what the implications of which in regards to peripheral support:

1. Will the new MacBook be able to drive a 4K display at 60 Hz? 
	* I spoke with an Apple representative, and he was not able to give me a definitive answer
		* The [specs][apple] page is no help
2. If so, will it 'reduce' the bandwidth of data transfers to ~USB 2.0 speeds, like Fingas alludes?

[April 10][cnet] can't come soon enough.
