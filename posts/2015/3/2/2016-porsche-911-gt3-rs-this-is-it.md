Raphael Orlove for Jalopnik:

> The cool details are a magnesium roof, carbon trunklid and engine cover, and a speed limiter. It says, in what is the most cheesy thing about the car, 'pit speed' on it. The rear wing is suitably massive, and Porsche claims the car can manage a 7:20 lap of the NÃ¼rburgring. That is bizonkers fast.

No word on the availability of a manual transmission.[^tr]

More from Orlove:

> The car costs 181,690 Euros, Die Welt reports.
>
> Comparing this car to the regular GT3, the RS is 10 kilos lighter, 25 horsepower and 30 ft-lbs stronger, and **50,000 Euros dearer** [emphasis added].

And in case your mental currency conversion skills are about as good as mine:[^ba]
