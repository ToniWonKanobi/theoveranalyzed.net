![Marco's Venn diagram][d]

Marco Arment, on Apple Watch:

> People will keep buying dumbwatches, and people who don’t buy dumbwatches will buy the Apple Watch. The big question is whether the people who buy dumbwatches and the Apple Watch will continue wearing and buying dumbwatches for very long.

> Once you’re accustomed to wearing one, going out for a night without your Apple Watch is going to feel like going out without your phone.

Fans of older, mechanical timepieces will have much to dismay over in regards to Apple Watch. I posited a similar notion [in my piece][theoveranalyzed] on wearing Apple Watch *and* a traditional watch. 

While I can hope my desire for a dumb watch will entitle it to be worn at least a couple times a week, the pragmatist in me says that might be wishful thinking. 

Come May 1, I should have a better idea whether the dumbwatches of yore might still have a place on my wrist.
