On the way to work yesterday, I listened to the [latest episode][1] of Exponent. The topic of conversation was, like always, pure excellence.

Their focus was Net Neutrality. And while both Ben and James are ardent supporters of regulation in this regard, Ben brought up an important rebuttal to the typical 'tech-focused' Net Neutrality argument.[^1]

In a nutshell, Ben argues that instead of blindly supporting Net Neutrality, which cannot be 100% good, we might do better to fully acknowledge and come to terms with the ramifications of our desire to regulate the internet.**Net Neutrality comes with [tradeoffs][2]**, and here's how the that tradeoff unfolds:

* Net Neutrality *could* leave the ISPs with little to no incentive to build out their services. I'm still unconvinced that this will be a true de-incentivization, but Ben is way smarter than me, so there's that.
	* Why would they want to build out their service if they cannot charge content providers more to deliver their content to customers ("[Fast Lanes][3]")?
* Net Neutrality *could* then force the ISPs to find new ways to monetize their customers, since they cannot utilize Fast Lanes. 
* ISPs would be forced to pass on higher monthly costs to the customers who use more data than others
	* Before Net Neutrality, the users who consumed less data actually subsidized people like me, who use more data.[^2] 

While paying more per month is never an ideal situation, I think privacy and net neutrality advocates would gladly accept higher monthly costs in exchange for absolute transparency and a free internet.

Here's Nilay Patel and Chris Plant discussing Net Neutrality's big development last week:
