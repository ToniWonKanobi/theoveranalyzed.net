Kayne West:

> I love Steve Jobs, he’s my [favorite] person, but there’s one thing that disappoints me. When Steve passed he didn’t give the ideas up. That’s kinda selfish.

I can say with 100% certainty that in this situation, Kayne literally does not know what he is talking about.

Jim Dalrymple had the [scoop][1], and I'll quote his response here:

> What a moron.
