Megan Thielking, for Vox, recently [quoted][vox] David Lewis, an allergy and immunology researcher at Stanford for a related piece:
>But lab animals like mice and other rodents don’t develop allergies spontaneously like humans do. Scientists can understand certain parts of the immune responses, like how allergy symptoms work, but those methods “leave a lot to be desired,” Lewis says.

What's funny is that this article wasn't even about the idiocy of testing human medical solutions on animals. Lewis' quote above was more an aside than some huge proclamation.

But if that quote above doesn't summarize everything that is fundamentally wrong with animal testing, I'm not sure what does.
