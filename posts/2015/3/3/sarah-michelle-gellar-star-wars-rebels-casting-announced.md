Peter Sciretta, for /Film:

> Filoni [series executive producer/supervising director] said, “We’re thrilled to have Sarah Michelle Gellar on board for season two. She is a true ‘Star Wars Rebels’ fan and her passion undoubtedly comes through in the voice recording sessions.”

Star Wars Rebels, the [critically acclaimed][slashfilm] new series, concluded its first season last night, and boy was it great. I'm excited to see what the writers do with whomever Gellar will portray.[^g] I won't spoil it for you. [See it for yourself][apple].

## Update: Gellar to Play Leia?

Maybe Gellar won't be playing Kanan's love interest, [after all][wikipedia]?

From an Instagram photo, here's Sarah Michelle Gellar:

> I'm super excited to announce that I will be on the [#StarWarsRebels][swr] panel at [#NYCC][nycc] on 10/8, 1:30pm, on the Empire Stage (of course). Hope to see you there! [#StarWars][sw] [@starwars][sww] Now whatever should I wear?

## Update: Nope, She's Not Playing Leia

Keely Flaherty, for [BuzzFeed][buzzfeed]:

> It seems she won’t be joining the Jedi ranks. Her character, the Seventh Sister Inquisitor, is a cunning and crafty villain.

So there you go. My hypothesis was completely incorrect, after all.

[^g]: I'm going to go on record right now and suggest that Gellar will play a love interest for [Kanan][wikia]. After all, it would only [make sense][huffingtonpost].
