>Filoni [series executive producer/supervising director] said, “We’re thrilled to have Sarah Michelle Gellar on board for season two. She is a true ‘Star Wars Rebels’ fan and her passion undoubtedly comes through in the voice recording sessions.”

Star Wars Rebels, the [critically acclaimed](http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-rebels-season-2/) new series, concluded its first season last night, and boy was it great. I'm excited to see what the writers do with whomever Gellar will portray.[^g] I won't spoil it for you. [See it for yourself](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/fire-across-the-galaxy/id920938545?at=1l3vx9s). 

[^g]: I'm going to go on record right now and suggest that Gellar will play a love interest for [Kanan](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kanan_Jarrus).
