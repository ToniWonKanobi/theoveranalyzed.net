Safari 9.0 for OS X 10.11 "El Capitan" offers this functionality built-in. In order to achieve this, keep the "Show Status Bar" option in View enabled. And then, whenever you hover on a hyperlink, the a small popup revealing the hyperlink destination will appear at the bottom-left of the window (where the 'normal' status bar lives).
