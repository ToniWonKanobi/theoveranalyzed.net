Gruber linked to a [piece][daringfireball] earlier today, which led me to another excerpt from Rick Tetzeli's and Brent Schlender's upcoming book [Becoming Steve Jobs][amazon]:
>Eight weeks after Steve told Cook he was making him CEO, things took a sudden turn for the worse. "I watched a movie with him the Friday before he passed away," Cook remembers. "We watched Remember the Titans [a sentimental football story about an underdog]. I was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie. I was like, ‘Are you sure?’ Steve was not interested in sports at all. And we watched and we talked about a number of things and I left thinking that he was pretty happy. And then all of a sudden things went to hell that weekend."

*This* is the caliber of content I want to read about Steve Jobs (and Apple on the whole).[^more]
