Gruber linked to a [piece](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/03/17/jobs-cook) earlier today, which led me to another excerpt from Rick Tetzeli's and Brent Schlender's upcoming book "[Becoming Steve Jobs](http://amazon.com/dp/0385347405/?tag=theov0c-20)":
>Eight weeks after Steve told Cook he was making him CEO, things took a sudden turn for the worse. "I watched a movie with him the Friday before he passed away," Cook remembers. "We watched Remember the Titans [a sentimental football story about an underdog]. I was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie. I was like, ‘Are you sure?’ Steve was not interested in sports at all. And we watched and we talked about a number of things and I left thinking that he was pretty happy. And then all of a sudden things went to hell that weekend."

*This* is the caliber of content I want to read about Steve Jobs (and Apple on the whole).[^Listen to [this](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42) (and [this](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/43)) for an explainer as to why the [Issacson biography](http://amazon.com/dp/1442369051) completely [missed the mark](http://www.marco.org/2012/02/15/walter-isaacsons-steve-jobs), at least as far as Apple fans are concerned.]
