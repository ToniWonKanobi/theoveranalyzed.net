Benedict Evans recently wrote about why Apple might have the audacity to make a gold watch:
>Ultimately, though, how many people buy the gold one is probably immaterial. 

>So (and this is the question that actually matters) why bother? One could argue that it’s a vanity project, or that Apple’s doing this just because it can, or that a few hundred million dollars still matters at Apple (as indeed it does). But I think it’s more interesting to compare it with Apple retail. Despite its prominence, this is only about 10% of Apple’s revenue. It’s much more important as marketing. And it’s great marketing. 

Good point. Apple isn't selling a gold watch 'just because.'[^al] While Apple Retail may not be the most profitable branch of Apple's revenue stream, it is most definitely part of their brand cache. 

I hate going into the Apple stores. But I don't hate it because of the layout, or any other common reason to hate a shopping experience. I hate it because of the people. I hate the stores because there are just so many consumers there to buy the latest and greatest Apple is offering. Here's the thing, though: If it weren't for the hoards if idiot consumers, I would love the Apple Retail experience. It is the embodiment of everything that is great about iOS, OS X, and Apple on the whole. 

Apple Watch Edition isn't a 'thing' simply so Apple can make an extra few bucks beyond the sales of the Apple Watch collection. Edition is a thing because it carries with it brand equity. And a powerful one at that.

[^al]: Although, they very well *could* do so, if they were so inclined. Evans suggests this much in his piece.
