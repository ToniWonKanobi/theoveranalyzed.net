I too have been using DuckDuckGo to power my searches for the past few months. It might even be up to a year at this point, but I just can't remember that far back. And despite its occasional shortcomings when it comes to images, Google is still a *little* bit better at finding random images, such as product box images that I use in eBay listings. It is *absolutely* the best search engine out there.

And as was the case for Casey, once Apple added DuckDuckGo to iOS 8 as an option for the default search engine in MobileSafari.app, I stopped using DuckDuckGo's [older, wonkier solution][lifehacker].

They do have an [iOS app][apple], which is decent, but I hate that it doesn't launch with a 'fresh,' [Drafts][apple 2]-style blank slate. 

And finally, Casey points out some great  `!bang operator`'s that you can add to your search queries.

I use `!so`[^so], `!ebay`,[^eb] and `!a`.[^am]

Don't take Casey's or my advice. Try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed (only Google will be disappointed).

[^am]: Amazon: the Wal-Mart of our time
[^so]: [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow]
[^eb]: eBay searches are nice with DuckDuckGo, because you can modify the bang operator with normal eBay query stuffs. For instance, if I wanted to search for Marco's [latest and greatest][marco] headphone [recommendation][marco 2], the [BeoPlay H6][amazon]'s, but want to omit erroneous results featuring the not-wanted [H8][amazon 2]'s, I can search with the query `!ebay beoplay h6 -h8`. So great.
