Jason Snell of Six Colors, writing for Macworld:
>In the end, though, if I’m going to invest in a new smartwatch, and I’m an iPhone user, my money has to go to the Apple Watch. It’s being crafted to work seamlessly with iOS. If it’s not more reliable than the Pebble at relaying notifications to my wrist, I’ll eat my hat. Third-party app developers are rushing to embrace WatchKit, and I’d wager that on day one there will be vastly better third-party app support for Apple Watch than could have possibly existed for Pebble.

My thoughts exactly. Truthfully, Pebble Time seems to feature a way more elegant UI/UX than Apple Watch, which is about as iOS 7/8-y that an interface can get.[^id]

But if I am going to have the audacity to wear a screen on  my wrist, it better be as useful as possible. And since I am an iOS user, Pebble Time[^or] just won't fit the bill.

[^id]: I don't miss the iOS 6 and lower UI/UX per se, but man, I sure miss some texture elements here and there. Plain old text with arrows gets really ugly and tiresome after a while.
[^or]: Or really, anything other than Apple Watch.
