### History

I started using [Aleksander Vacic][1]'s [Go Couch to 5k][2] a few months ago. I got to about the 6th week, which was a great place to be, as most of the runs consisted of at least 15-20 mins of solid "jog time," in contrast to the previous weeks' level of jogging.[^1]

Sadly, I stopped exercising completely in the wake of all my website stuffs.[^2]

### Next

I read Federico Viticci's inspiring [story][3] about sickness, and decided I should get back into fitness myself.[^3]

### The Story

I created a [Storify][4] to summarize Federico's experience:

<div class="storify"><iframe src="//storify.com/ToniWonKanobi/viticci-federico-cancer-aarrow-therapy-fitness/embed?border=false&amp;template=slideshow"></iframe><script src="//storify.com/ToniWonKanobi/viticci-federico-cancer-aarrow-therapy-fitness.js?border=false&amp;template=slideshow"></script><noscript>[<a href="//storify.com/ToniWonKanobi/viticci-federico-cancer-aarrow-therapy-fitness" target="_blank">View the story "Federico Viticci: Cancer, Therapy, and Fitness" on Storify</a>]</noscript></div>

### Now

My small little blog is very important to me, but I would be terribly remiss if I passed away in ten years because I chose to not take care of myself now. Whatever story or link I want to share, or whatever small design change I just can't want to get out---that stuff can wait.

Why not take my dog for a run?

Why not spend more time with my wife?

I am vegetarian, and mostly vegan when I can be, so it's not like I'm the *most* unhealthy eater on the planet. Still, exercise is just as important as diet, and it is never too late to be in the best shape I can be.

### What I Might Use to Help Me

Here are a few standout apps mentioned by Federico, ones I would like to incorporate into my routines:

* [FitStar][5]

I have used [TinyHeart][6]'s workout [apps][7] before, but it's time to step-up my game. When I did [P90X][8] and [Insanity][9] a few years ago, I was sweating *way* more than I do now when I use the "Quick" workout apps. 

* [Pillow][10]

Sleep tracking may not sound like it is important, but sometimes, I find myself sluggish throughout the day, without a good idea why that might be the case. Am I sleeping poorly? Not getting enough? Is my 6 hours not sufficient? 

Hopefully, all those questions will be answered by Pillow.

Finally, I will continue to use the running app I started with:

* [Go 5k][11]

The developer recently teased this [video][12], detailing how Apple Watch will fit into things.[^4]

### Too Cliche?

Federico's story isn't just about being fit. What I take from his experience is this: 

Living life to the fullest doesn't mean doing whatever is the most fun. It means doing whatever you can to prolong and enrich your life, so that you can enjoy the world as you would like.

[^1]: Typically around 5 minutes per each stint
[^2]: Integrating footnotes, permalinks, and general HTML/CSS Squarespace hackery
[^3]: Nothing like a story about people with much greater struggles than yourself to inspire change
[^4]: Super excited about this. Now we just need wireless EarPods or something
