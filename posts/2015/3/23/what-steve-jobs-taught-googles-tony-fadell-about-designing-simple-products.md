Greg Ferenstein, on Tony Fadell's TED Talk earlier this year:
>[He] talked about shipping a product with a charged battery. Only a few years ago, it was all-to-common to unwrap a new MP3 player with the glee of christmas morning, only to find out we had to wait a few hours to charge the device.

I've been there. Have you?

Ferenstein continues:
>This is a piss-poor first impression for a product. Now, Apple products, he says, come with at least a partially charged battery. 

Yet another example of one of the 'little things' that makes Apple products a step above the competition. 

This seems like an interesting watch. I'll be sure to link to it when it becomes available online.
