Stephen Hall, for 9to5Mac:

> Not only does the new map bring in customer-verified coverage data for sections as small as 100 square meters, but T-Mobile is also bringing in information from third-parties like Speedtest.net, Inrix and others, to verify that this data is accurate and complete.

[For quite some time now][cnet], T-Mobile has been shaking things up in the mobile carrier industry. They have made *huge* strides to better serve their customers. And it's not just on the bottom end of things. Yes, making service cheaper will entice people to jump ship from the bigger carriers like Verizon and AT&T. It's news like today's. 

I can't imagine the other carriers doing something in a similar vain, being honest with their explanations of data coverage.  

I tried T-Mobile during my Android experiment a few years ago, long before the [Uncarrier][t-mobile] movement. If it weren't for Verizon's having better service where I live in Southern Calfiornia, I would have stayed with T-Mobile simply because their business model inspires confidence and good feelings from their customers (moreso than their competitors).
