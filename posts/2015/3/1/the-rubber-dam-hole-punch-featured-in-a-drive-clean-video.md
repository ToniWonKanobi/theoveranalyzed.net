Do you like cars?

If you haven't seen anything on [/DRIVE CLEAN][youtube], you should check it out.

[Larry Kosilla][twitter] came up [with Matt Farah][carsalways] and the [rest][wikipedia]) of the [/DRIVE][youtube 2] crew. His focus is detailing/restoring cars. I'm not talking 'back your car into the driveway and spray it down and call it a day' type detailing. No: I'm talking about *[detailing][youtube 3]*-detailing. 

I've enjoyed watching almost all of his uploads not only because of their informative nature, but also because it is just plain entertaining to see someone so dedicated and in love with their job, doing their thing.

But, that's not the only reason I enjoy his videos.

**It's all about the cars[^ca]**

He and his company [AMMO NYC][ammonyc] have serviced some of [the most special cars][youtube 4] out there. And while I love the ol' [Everyday Driver][youtube 5][^ed] or [Chris Harris][youtube 6] review as much as the next guy, there's no replacement for Kosilla's [up-close-and-personal takes on some amazing pieces of automotive engineering][youtube 7].

His latest video featured Danbury, Connecticut's [CoachTrim,][advancedleatherworkshop][^ct] which specializes in restoring and upgrading car interiors.   

Take a look at these screenshots:

That metal "tool" ("instrument") looks an awful lot like this:

![Rubber Dam Punch Example][robinsonhealthcare]

This is a hole punch used to, well, "punch" a hole in a dental dam, sometimes called a "[rubber dam][wikipedia 2]." Dentists might use a rubber dam for a myriad of dental procedures, most commonly in conjunction with root canal therapy. The hole punch is used to make a hole(s) in the dam, so that the dentist could then pass that hold around the tooth or teeth to be operated upon, and thereby obtain a relatively clean/dry field. 

Example:

Every once in a while something like this will come up, and its interesting to note how/when dentistry might permeate 'regular people' situations. 

[^ca]: Larry recently bought a 964 C4. Several of his videos have focused on restoring and modifying (hot rodding) his old 911. Obviously, those are my favorite.
[^ed]: Especially [this one][vimeo]
[^ct]: In my younger days of internet-ing, I would have taken one look at CoachTrim's website and thought, "Man, these guys must have a terribly junky operation going on, because their website is atrocious." Don't get me wrong: their website is definitely atrocious. But I watched the video. And it left me with this: there couldn't be a finer example out there of great guys doing great work in their field. *Who cares about the website?* Based on my own anecdotal research on the internet, it seems the absolute *best* shops would rather be practicing their trade than spending money on web design. It's like all those hole-in-the-wall restaurants you might frequent. No amount of trendy lighting will ever convince me that the local Chipotle would beat out [Maria's Cafe][urbanspoon] for Mexican-fare.
