Somedays it is less hard than others, but every time I back out of the driveway to go to somewhere, and [Smokey][1] is not with me, I worry about him. I am not so worried about what might happen *in the house* while we are gone.

I am worried about what might happen to him *if he gets out*.

A few months back, I bought a [Whistle Activity Monitor][2], in the hopes that I would be granted access to [Whistle GPS][3].[^1] Whistle had always envisioned being able to bring GPS tracking to pets. Apparently, the task was more than Whistle alone could handle, so they acquired [Tagg][4], the foremost GPS-based pet tracking company. 

I recall catching wind of Tagg at this year's CES, and I had a rather opinionated take on their prospects. My thoughts were premised on the notion that Whistle GPS was going to be a thing, and based on the web/UI/UX differences between Whistle and Tagg (Tagg being the lesser), I assumed Tagg would flop:

<blockquote lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/taggtracker" title="Tagg on Twitter">@taggtracker</a> Soooo <a href="https://twitter.com/verge" title="The Verge on Twitter">@verge</a> featured you for their <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2015?src=hash" title="Tweets tagged 'CES2015'">#CES2015</a> coverage ...&#10;&#10;... And your iPhone app is at least from 2011, if not earlier :/</p>&mdash; Anthony Craig (@ToniWonKanobi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToniWonKanobi/status/552312590064709634" title="My question on Twitter">January 6, 2015</a></blockquote>

The hope is that, a short time in the future, if we ever have to leave Smokey again, he will be *much* more retrievable than he currently might be, without GPS tracking.

This could change everything about leaving your pet behind.[^2]
