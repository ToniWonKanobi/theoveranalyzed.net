Adam Grossman, with Forecast.io / Dark Sky:
>Getting a Dark Sky notification on your wrist just feels different. A little chime, a gentle tap on your wrist, and a quick glance; the effortlessness of it makes it feel qualitatively different than receiving a notification on your phone. It’s both far less intrusive and far less likely to be missed.

Grossman continues:
>The app isn’t just about notifications, however. It’s a full-featured weather app designed from scratch to fit on your wrist, providing detailed current conditions and an overview of today and the next five days.

>Dark Sky for Apple Watch will be a free upgrade, available on day one.

I challenge anyone to show me a development team on Android that can put this much thought into a watch app (let alone a phone or tablet app).
