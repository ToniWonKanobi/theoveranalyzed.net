![Jony Ive][1]

I still haven't read The New Yorker's Jony Ive [piece,][2] but this one by Nick Foulkes was a nice intro. 

There were also some neat little tidbits about Apple Watch:

Here's Foulkes quoting Ive:

> "One of the things that struck me,” says Ive, “was how often I’d look at my watch and have to look again quite soon afterwards, because I hadn’t actually comprehended what the time was. If I had looked at something on my phone, because of the investment involved in taking it out of my pocket or my bag, I would certainly pay attention. I quite like this sense of almost being careless and just glancing. I think for certain things the wrist is the perfect place for this technology.

Happy to know I'm not the only imbecile who has to occasionally do a second-glance to discern what those precious little hour/minute hands are actually conveying.

Foulkes continues:

> However, it was not without some trepidation that he embarked on the watch. “It was different with the phone – all of us working on the first iPhone were driven by an absolute disdain for the cellphones we were using at the time. That’s not the case here. We’re a group of people who love our watches. So we’re working on something, yet have a high regard for what currently exists.”

If Apple is trying to replace everyone's watches with their own, Ive's sincerity with the whole thing is a nice touch.

And on a more practical level, Foulkes had this to say about the strap options:

> The strap options alone are dazzling: there are ribbons of metal mesh that loop through each other to be held in place by magnets; there are others that click into place both mechanically and magnetically; there are straps of quilted leather; straps of fluoroelastomer; **metal bracelets with easily removable links** [emphasis added]; bracelets that can be swapped in and out.

So let that put to bed my fear that the link bracelet's 'one size fits all' did not really mean that the bracelet was non-adjustable.
