Steven Sande for Apple World Today: 
>What this tells us, of course, is that for a lot more people, the Apple Watch Sport may be the model that they'll go for. The price is right and they get the same functionality as the $10,000 model with a lot less pretentiousness.

I couldn't *disagree* more. I think, if anything, this will push people *upmarket* -- not downmarket -- to the Apple Watch collection, away from the Apple Watch Sport collection. 

Here's why:

It's the [iPad effect][daringfireball]. When iPad launched in 2010, everyone thought it would be priced at $1000. When it was *just* $500, it was even more of a must-have item.

The same will be true for Apple Watch collection. Gruber [thought][daringfireball 2] the Edition might fall closer to the $10,000 - $20,000 range.

With such a price differential between Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, people will *overwhelmingly* flock to the former instead of the latter. The difference in cost between the lowest Sport model and the highest Watch model is around $600. The difference between the lowest Watch and highest Edition is around $16,000. *There's an order of magnitude difference between the two differentials.*[^th]

Faced with a relatively[^ta] smaller price difference, why *wouldn't* you get a model in the Apple Watch collection instead of Apple Watch Sport?

[^th]: That's a lot of differences and differentials.
[^ta]: Talking $600 vs $16,000, mind you.
