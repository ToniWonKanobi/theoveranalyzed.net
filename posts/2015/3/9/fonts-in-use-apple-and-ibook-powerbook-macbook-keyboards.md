![Apple Keyboard (A1242), introduced with the iMac revision in 2009][1]

Stephen Coles, for Fonts In Use:

> In March 2015, Apple marked its first departure from VAG Rounded as a standard for its keyboards by using its own San Francisco typeface on their new MacBook models.

Pretty interesting stuff. I think [San Francisco][2] is a nice departure for Apple, as [VAG Rounded][3] was awfully cold-looking. Still, nothing touches [my favorite][4] Apple typeface.
