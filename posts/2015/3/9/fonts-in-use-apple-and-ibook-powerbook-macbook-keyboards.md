Stephen Coles, for Fonts In Use:
>In March 2015, Apple marked its first departure from VAG Rounded as a standard for its keyboards by using its own San Francisco typeface on their new MacBook models.

Pretty interesting stuff. I think [San Francisco][fontsinuse] is a nice departure for Apple, as [VAG Rounded][fontsinuse 2] was awfully cold-looking. Still, nothing touches [my favorite][fontsinuse 3] Apple typeface.
