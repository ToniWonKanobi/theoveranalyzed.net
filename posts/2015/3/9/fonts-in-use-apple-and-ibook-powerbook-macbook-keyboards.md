Stephen Coles, for Fonts In Use:
>In March 2015, Apple marked its first departure from VAG Rounded as a standard for its keyboards by using its own San Francisco typeface on their new MacBook models.

Pretty interesting stuff. I think [San Francisco](http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/32460/san-francisco-2014) is a nice departure for Apple, as [VAG Rounded](http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/4344/vag-rounded) was awfully cold-looking. Still, nothing touches [my favorite](http://fontsinuse.com/uses/5817/macintosh-logo-and-badge) Apple typeface.
