I'll admit, after listening to the [latest][imore] Debug featuring [Jon Edwards][twitter] and [others][https:], I thought to myself: "Why is there that stupid 'Contacts' [button][d] anyways? All it serves to do is destroy the symmetry of the crown-side of the Watch."

But after watching the keynote and seeing the demo, I'm convinced that while at least the placement of the button is questionable, the functionality is not questionable at all.

I think it will be incredibly useful. 

[April 24][apple], here I come.
