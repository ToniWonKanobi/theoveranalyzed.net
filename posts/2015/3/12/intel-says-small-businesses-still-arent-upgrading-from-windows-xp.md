When it comes time for me to buy/start my own practice in a few years, the biggest mental and emotional hurdle for me won't be all the normal dentist ones, such as patient base, staff, city codes, etc. 

My fear is that I will be forced to use one of the many crappy Windows-based practice management office suites that every other dentist out there uses.
