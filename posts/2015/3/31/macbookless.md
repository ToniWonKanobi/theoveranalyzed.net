As of four days ago, I have been MacBookless. I had my 11" MacBook Air for about a two months and I loved it. The Air was *so* much more portable than my previous laptop, a 13" MacBook Pro with Retina display. Yeah, half a pound doesn't sound like much. But combine that with the 11" MacBook Air's much smaller footprint, and I had the makings of a laptop I actually wanted to bring to work with me. And being able to bring a laptop to work has been a great experience, especially as I started writing more. I realized that I greatly prefer that to an iPad on the go.

In short, I loved that laptop.

That said, I think I will love the new MacBook even more. So I sold the MacBook Air in anticipation for buying the new one as soon as it comes out. Consequently, I have been hobbling along without OS X for almost a week now. It has been ... an experience. I will share some of that here.

***

I am writing this post on my iPhone 6 Plus, using a paired [Bluetooth keyboard][amazon]. And the last few posts I have put out---those have all been written in a similar fashion. Truly, the keyboard makes writing immensely better than without it. I can't imagine thumb typing my ~1000 word posts due to the limitations of iOS. 

The biggest take-home for me is that iOS, while seemingly an oasis for distracted-types like myself, tends to cripple me rather than enable. Yes, full screen apps make for a focused writing experience. And yes, the [bigger] iPhone 6 Plus screen makes it even easier to type longer passages on my phone. And yes, the combination of an iPhone 6 Plus and a keyboard still weighs less and takes up less space than even the 11" MacBook Air. Win, win, win.

**And yet,** I can't help but miss my MacBook. And thus, I am becoming increasingly impatient for the new MacBook's arrival.

Federico Viticci has been using iOS (mostly his iPad Air 1 slash 2) as his [main operating system for years][macstories]. When I say "main," I mean "*main*." Viticci doesn't just use his iPad on the go: he uses it at home as well. In fact, he uses his iPad about as much as I used my MacBook. That's a lot.

Going without a MacBook meant going without a keyboard. But more important than that: going MacBookless meant going without OS X. And that hurts even *more* than the lack of an integrated keyboard. 

Consider this post. I made reference to Federico Viticci and his iPad usage. When I am on OS X, I simply `Command + Tab` back to Safari, and then do a quick DuckDuckGo search for `site:macstories.net ipad`. After finding the relevant source to support my reference, I copy it to the keyboard, and then `Command + Tab` back into [MultiMarkdown Composer][apple], or [Byword][apple 2] previously. Next, I would then use a hotkey for a [service][brettterpstra] by Brett Terpstra to insert the clipboard link into my text. I can do almost all of that on the keyboard. I use the trackpad to highlight the search field in the Safari window, but besides that, I can use hotkeys and other keystrokes.

On iOS, it is *much* more difficult than that. Now, admittedly, I do not use [Editorial][apple 3] like [Viticci][macstories 2], nor some other workflow aggregation app such as [Workflow][apple 4] or [Drafts][apple 5]. 

Why not? Because I haven't ever done any huge amount of writing on iOS. Because I have always seen OS X as my main operating system (even in the post-iPhone days), I have used my Mac to write, not my iPhone or iPad. And so, because of this, I haven't developed complex workflows that leverage iOS 8's extensibility to make writing easier (like [Viticci][macstories 3] has). If I were going to dedicate myself to all-iOS writing, I might change my attitude. 

But I'm not going to go 'all in' on iOS for my writing. Maybe it's because I grew in the days before mobile computing? Or maybe it's because I love an attached keyboard? Or, just maybe, it is because I am a nerd? What I do know is that my 'default' computing experience is a conventional computer, not a mobile device. When I want to look something up, I want a keyboard and big screen in front of me so I can type what I want in a search field. I want to manipulate an exposed filesystem. I want to tweak and tweak and tweak. That is just want feels natural. 

Don't get me wrong: mobile computing *is* terribly convenient. Sometimes it is impractical to have a laptop with me, and in those situations, a mobile computer is invaluable. But every time I have to use my iPhone to do something I can do my computer,[^co] I can't help but feel slightly disappointed. I also feel slightly stressed, because who knows how difficult it will be to use a mobile webpage or crappy webapp? Because I prefer a conventional computer in general, it makes sense that my preferences there inform my writing preferences as well.

There are other aspects of OS X that I miss when it comes to writing. While the 11" MacBook Air's 1366 x 768 display is definitely small compared to most laptops, it was still 'bigger' than the iPad's in that I could have multiple apps on a single field of view. The MacBook Air's display isn't that much more roomy than an iPad Air's, but its *effective* real estate is, due to multitasking. This might be [coming soon][appleinsider], but as of right now, that's not possible on iOS. 

I also miss small things like easy affiliate linking. I recently started using an app called [Affiliate][apple 6], which is a menubar service that monitors the clipboard for Amazon or iTunes product links. If a link is copied to the clipboard, Affiliate automatically appends my affiliate tag before copying that new link to the clipboard. [Blink][apple 7] is an iOS app that aims to do something similar, but ultimately cannot replace Affiliate due to limitations in iOS. The same, but different.

My MacBookless <s>horror</s> adventure will be over soon enough. And when it is all said and done, it will have been a good experience. 

A while back, I actually toyed with going all-iOS. The iPad Air 2's specs are quickly approaching the Core i5 processors in the MacBook Air's. Moreover, the iPad Air 2's abilities probably come even *closer* to approximating the processing power of Core M in the new MacBook I plan to buy. 

Still, despite the spec prowess of the iPad Air 2, this experience has shown me that I can't go without OS X. Ever since crossing over in 2006, the Mac OS is my home. It is what feels familiar, and it is where I do my best computing. I can't wait to greet it again in a few weeks. 

[^co]: Like writing a new post for TheOverAnalyzed. In the past few days, I have actually put off writing, something I never did on during my OS X days. I am putting off writing because it is a pain to write a post on iOS compared to OS X. And that's sad.
