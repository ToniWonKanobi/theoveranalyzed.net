# Introduction

Ever since the keynote yesterday morning, I have been trying to make two important decisions as they relate to Apple Watch:

1. What size to get -- [38 mm or 42 mm][theoveranalyzed]?
 2. Which collection should I choose from -- Apple Watch Sport, or Apple Watch?

# Size

I just measured my wrist and, unsurprisingly, my 168 mm circumference lands right in the not-so-sweet spot of 'too big for 38 mm' and 'too small for 42 mm.' I suppose I just need to decide how gaudy I want this new wrist-borne screen to look on me.[^wh][^up]

It's the second question I have more trouble with. 

## Watch or Watch Sport?

## Apple Watch

Let's face it: The "[Space Black Stainless][apple]" is the one to get. It's mysterious, it's handsome, and most importantly, it's black. 

The black models of anything have always been the best choice.[^re] And it's not just Apple or technology where black is better. Black will always be -- unapologetically I might add -- the most [BA][urbandictionary] of car colors. There have been historical outliers, such as our current trend of white cars. And before white, there was gray.[^rem] But [even today][astroawani], across the wide range of car manufacturers, black is still, well, *black*. 

As an aside, I don't remember Apple Watch in Space Black Stainless being so dang dark last September. I actually like it even more now that it's darker.[^di] Interestingly, Apple has set the Space Black version of Apple Watch  collection apart from the rest of the Apple Watch collection. In order to obtain that luscious fingerprint magnet of a case, you *have* to buy the link bracelet. And, not so interestingly, the link bracelet carries a rather hefty price bump from the fluoroelastomer of $600. Is it worth it?

## Apple Watch Sport

Truthfully, try as I might, I can't help but fee like Apple Watch's Space Black has at least *twice* the visceral appeal of Apple Watch Sport. 

Still, the Apple Watch Sport in "Space Gray" is no laughing matter. It is quite handsome in its own right. On the [latest episode][relay] of Upgrade, Jason Snell said that he actually preferred the anodized aluminum of the Apple Watch Sport over the shiny 'stainlessness' of Apple Watch. I am beginning to feel the same.

Another benefit to choosing Apple Watch Sport is that the fluoroelastomer band[^rub] is somewhat size-adaptive. This is in contrast to the link bracelet of the Apple Watch collection, which is apparently *just* '[one-size-fits-all][d].'[^sou] How can a single-sized link bracelet work for both the small-wristed and the large-wristed person? Does one have to take into consideration the band size when deciding between the 38 mm and 42 mm cases? What if the face of the 42 mm works best on the face of things, but the band size of the 38 mm is best for the wrist circumference? Now, obviously, I could buy the Apple Watch in Space Black Stainless and just get a black fluoroelastomer band for running. In fact, this is what I had planned to do all along. But if the link bracelet -- the *defining* band of the Space Black Stainless model -- is loosey-goosey on my wrist, what's the point of getting the link bracelet at all?

# Decisions, Decisions.

I'll leave you with this, a conversation with a friend who knows me all too well. We were talking about which case size to get, but really, I could apply his advise to almost every Apple hardware decision I have ever made:

# Update

Casey Liss [linked][caseyliss] to this [post][exactfitnessapps] by fitness company Exact Fitness, in which you can print out a mockup, cut it out, and 'try on' an Apple Watch in whatever size/band choice you are considering. 

I used something [similar][instagram] last September when there were [suddenly][thenextweb] *two* iPhone sizes to choose from.

# Another Update

I found this little nugget of knowledge regarding the Apple Watch link bracelet:

[^up]: Update: I found this [article][mcelhearn], which noted how the Apple Store iOS app includes actual-size [screen] previews of both cases sizes. So that helps.
[^re]: Remember [this][512pixels], and now, [this][twitter]?
[^rem]: Remember when gray supplanted black as the 'it' color for the 997?
[^di]: Did Apple change the finish or did the previous images depict the same watch but in a different light?
