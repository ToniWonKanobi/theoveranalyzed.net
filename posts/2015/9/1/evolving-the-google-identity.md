> The Google logo has always had a simple, friendly, and approachable style. We wanted to retain these qualities by combining the mathematical purity of geometric forms with the childlike simplicity of schoolbook letter printing. Our new logotype is set in a custom, geometric sans-serif typeface and maintains the multi-colored playfulness and rotated ‘e’ of our previous mark—a reminder that we’ll always be a bit unconventional.

I was going to spend my time bemoaning Google's overtly geometric sans-serif font choice, but then I watched this:

Wow---the logotype looks *much* better in the full [Material Design][google] setting. Bravo, Google.[^still]

[^still]: I still wish they would have chosen a less "perfect" sans-serif, but I'm partial to [~serif fonts hiding beneath the "sans-serif" banner][typography].
