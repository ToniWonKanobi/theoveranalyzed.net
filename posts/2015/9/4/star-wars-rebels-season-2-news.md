> Dave Filoni hosts a special Season 2 preview on the Star Wars Rebels Season One blu-ray set.

> * The Inquisitor in season one was the “Grand Inquisitor,” the Inquisitors in season two were ranked below him.
> * Sabine changes her hair and armor because meeting Vader was such a harrowing experience
> * Zeb has an “awakening” in season two and comes into a better understanding of what happened to his people and who his adversary really is.
> * A better back story on Hera, who her father is, what is the situation with her father, where she came from and her people.
> * A great new bounty hunter
> * There will be a Sabine/Kanan episode, which will feature some “more Mandalorian things” that will go on.
> * You will find out about Ezra and his parents
> * You will find out how Ahsoka and Rex effect the dynamics of the crew
> * You will find out, Does Ahsoka Tano know who Darth Vader is? Does Ahsoka ever confront Vader?
> * There is one character so exciting and so top secret he wouldn’t elaborate on besides saying it would have major ramifications on the future of our characters.

Sounds like Season 2 will answer a lot of the questions posed at the end of Season 1.
