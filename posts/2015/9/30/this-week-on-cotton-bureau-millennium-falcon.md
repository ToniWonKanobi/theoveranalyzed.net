I've been listening to [Relay FM][1]'s space-themed podcast [Liftoff][2]. Also, I follow one of the co-hosts, [Stephen Hackett][3], so I'm [aware][4] of a recent [Kickstarter project][5] that resurrects an old NASA Graphics Standard Manual. Consequently, this NASA "[mission patch][6]"-inspired Star Wars shirt immediately caught my eye.
