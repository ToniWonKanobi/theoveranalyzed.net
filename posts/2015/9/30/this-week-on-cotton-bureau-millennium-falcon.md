I've been listening to [Relay FM][rl]'s space-themed podcast [Liftoff][relay]. Also, I follow one of the co-hosts, [Stephen Hackett][twitter], so I'm [aware][512pixels] of a recent [Kickstarter project][kickstarter] that resurrects an old NASA Graphics Standard Manual. Consequently, this NASA "[mission patch][mp]"-inspired Star Wars shirt immediately caught my eye.
