In my day-to-day emoji-ing, I often use the animals found in the [Nature](http://emojipedia.org/nature/) category. I like [birds of prey](http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/2015/4/2/red-tailed-hawks), and for the longest time, the only way to represent that category of avians has been with the [Bird](http://emojipedia.org/bird/) emoji -- an emoji that looks more like a pigeon than anything else.

And now (Finallyâ„¢) it seems that an [Eagle](http://emojipedia.org/eagle/) might be coming to an Emoji keyboard near you. While it probably won't make it in time for the upcoming iPhone 6S, it might land on the iPhone 7 if everything goes according to plan. 

Here's Jeremy Burge of the Emojipedia Blog:
>[Unicode 8](http://emojipedia.org/unicode-8/) included missing animals that had associated zodiac symbols, such as the [lion](http://emojipedia.org/lion-face/) and [crab](http://emojipedia.org/crab/).

>[Unicode 9](http://emojipedia.org/unicode-9/) endeavours to include other animals that are common around the world, but not yet included in the emoji set.
