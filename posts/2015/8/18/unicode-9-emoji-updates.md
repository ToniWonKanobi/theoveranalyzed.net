In my day-to-day emoji-ing, I often use the animals found in the [Nature][1] category. I like [birds of prey][2], and for the longest time, the only way to represent that category of avians has been with the [Bird][3] emoji---an emoji that looks more like a pigeon than anything else.

And now (Finallyâ„¢) it seems that an [Eagle][4] might be coming to an Emoji keyboard near you. While it probably won't make it in time for the upcoming iPhone 6S, it might land on the iPhone 7 if everything goes according to plan. 

Here's Jeremy Burge of the Emojipedia Blog:

> [Unicode 8][5] included missing animals that had associated zodiac symbols, such as the [lion][6] and [crab][7].
>
> [Unicode 9][8] endeavours to include other animals that are common around the world, but not yet included in the emoji set.
