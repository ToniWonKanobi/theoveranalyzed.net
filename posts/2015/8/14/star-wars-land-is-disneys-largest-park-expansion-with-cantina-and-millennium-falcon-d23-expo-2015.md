Peter Sciretta, writing for /Film:
>Star Wars Land will be a wholly in-character experience, with alien servers and workers at all parts of the attraction, including a Cantina. Guests will have the opportunity to enjoy two signature attractions, including one that puts fans inside the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. Bob Iger said, “these new lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet, including an epic Star Wars adventure that puts you in the middle of a climactic battle between the First Order and the Resistance.”

Looks like I'll actually have a reason to go to Disneyland. 

No word yet as to when the expansion should be finished.

<h3>Update August 17, 2015</h3>

On the topic of *when*, it seems that there's still no official word. [Peter Sciretta][more] today wrote further on the matter, offering his speculation as to the parks eventual opening:
>So if construction begins in mid 2017 in Disneyland, I would expect a 2022 opening date.

Seven years is a long time to wait, but it seems like Star Wars Land will be rather neat.
