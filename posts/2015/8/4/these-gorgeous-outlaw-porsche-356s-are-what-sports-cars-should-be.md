I watch [Jay Leno's Garage][jlg].[^th] Although I wish he'd resist the urge to posit on everything that has happened in the past 100 years of automobiles, watching his show is still a net positive for a car lover like myself. Jay's a down-to-earth car dude. Unlike other [big-name Hollywood cats][comediansincarsgettingcoffee], he's not afraid to like [American automobiles][youtube]. It's no secret that Jay's a big fan of [Corvettes][youtube 2]. That said, he also fancies everyone's [favorite][youtube 3] [German][youtube 4] [manufacturer][youtube 5].

On this latest episode, [Rod Emory][emorymotorsports] showed up with a couple of sweet [356][wikipedia]'s.

A couple of interesting bits:

1. [Jay has an Apple Watch][macrumors]:

2. The inside of a 356 is *small*:

[^th]: That is to say, I watch the videos posted to his YouTube channel. I don't watch regular-person TV.
