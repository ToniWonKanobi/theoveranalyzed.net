I watch Jay Leno's Garage. Although I wish he'd resist the urge to posit on everything that has happened in the past 100 years of automobiles, watching his show is still a net positive for car lovers. Jay's a down-to-earth car-guy. Unlike other big-name Hollywood cats, he's not afraid to like American automobiles. It's no secret that Jay's a big fan of Corvettes. That said, he also fancies everyone's favorite German manufacturer.

On this latest episode, Rod Emory showed up with a couple of sweet 356's.

A couple of interesting bits:

1. Jay has an Apple Watch
