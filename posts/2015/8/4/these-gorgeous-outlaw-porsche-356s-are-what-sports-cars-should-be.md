I watch [Jay Leno's Garage][1].[^1] Although I wish he'd resist the urge to posit on everything that has happened in the past 100 years of automobiles, watching his show is still a net positive for a car lover like myself. Jay's a down-to-earth car dude. Unlike other [big-name Hollywood cats][2], he's not afraid to like [American automobiles][3]. It's no secret that Jay's a big fan of [Corvettes][4]. That said, he also fancies everyone's [favorite][5] [German][6] [manufacturer][7].

On this latest episode, [Rod Emory][8] showed up with a couple of sweet [356][9]'s.

A couple of interesting bits:

1. [Jay has an Apple Watch][10]:
