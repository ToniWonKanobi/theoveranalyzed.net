The other day, Allison asked me when the next season of Downton Abbey was coming out. I told her it would be sometime this fall. She then commented on how it wasn't likely to be very good.

[I agree with her hypothesis][theoveranalyzed].

We've faithfully watched every season of Downton Abbey, and we've watched the show [deteriorate season after season][rottentomatoes]. This seems like a great time to say goodbye to [Yorkshire's][wikipedia] finest.
