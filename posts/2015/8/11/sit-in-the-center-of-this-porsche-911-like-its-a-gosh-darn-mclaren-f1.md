In 2012, the Porsche Club of America featured the first-ever [Centro 911][wired], a center-drive converted 997 cabriolet, eventually becoming a [YouTube sensation][youtube].[^sen] 

[Trinity Motorsports][facebook] designed that original Centro 911. Since then, they also developed a coupe version, currently for sale on [Mecum Auctions][mecum].

From the auction's description:

> The conversion includes a mechanism allowing the front seat to slide left to the driverâ€™s door for ingress and egress.

Pretty neat. Although definitely *[not][youtube 2]* very McLaren F1-ish.

Mecum suggests that the car should go for something in the range of $85,000 to $115,000. Even for this one-off, that's a lot of money. For that amount of coin, you could buy [this][ebay] and have a real daily / track-day weapon.

[^sen]: "Sensation" in the most *relative* sense of the word when it comes to YouTube. At some ~50,000 views, this was PCA's most popular YouTube upload. To put that into perspective, [Chris Harris's review of the Singer 911 for /Drive][youtube 3] garnered around 27 times the amount of views that the Centro 911 collected to this date. Still, it was a popular video for PCA. No doubt about that.
