In 2012, the Porsche Club of America featured the first-ever "[Centro 911](http://www.wired.com/2012/11/porsche-center-wheel/)," a center-drive converted 997 cabriolet, eventually becoming a [YouTube sensation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv3twuUI5es).[^sen] 

[Trinity Motorsports](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.504606459563617.117761.156019671088966&type=3) designed that original Centro 911. Since then, they also developed a coupe version, currently for sale on [Mecum Auctions](https://www.mecum.com/lot-detail/CA0815-219883/0/2008-Porsche-911S/6-Speed/).

From the auction's description:
>The conversion includes a mechanism allowing the front seat to slide left to the driverâ€™s door for ingress and egress.

Pretty neat. Although definetly *[not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kLlmxUAB5A&feature=youtu.be&t=3m46s)* very McLaren F1-ish.

<hr class="small">

Mecum suggests that the car should go for something in the range of $85,000 to $115,000. Even for this one-off, that's a lot of money. For that amount of coin, you could buy [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Porsche-911-GT3-/281765598158?forcerrptr=true&hash=item419a89d3ce&item=281765598158) and have a real daily / trackday weapon.

[^sen]: "Sensation" in the most *relative* sense of the word when it comes to YouTube. At some ~50,000 views, this was PCA's most popular YouTube upload. To put that into perspective, [Chris Harris's review of the Singer 911 for /Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJQ4hQSusjE) garnered around 27 times the amount of views that the Centro 911 collected to this date. Still, it was a popular video for PCA. No doubt about that.
