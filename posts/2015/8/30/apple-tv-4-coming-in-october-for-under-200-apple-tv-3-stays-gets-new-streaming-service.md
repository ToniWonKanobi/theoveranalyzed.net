According to Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac, the upcoming Apple TV 4 will have some new features to go along with the new pricetag:
>The new Apple TV will come at a premium price compared with the current model, which was originally priced at $99 from its launch in 2012, then was reduced to $69 this March. As the new box will be considerably more expensive than popular alternatives from Roku, Google and Amazon, Apple plans to keep the $69 third-generation device for sale as an entry level model within the Apple TV product line.

>Apple’s next-generation Apple TV will include a number of new features to differentiate itself from the older version, including Siri support, a new remote control, an App Store with a Software Development Kit for developers, and a refreshed user interface. As soon as next year, Apple plans to release a cable-replacing streaming TV service that bundles multiple television channels for a price as low as $40 per month, but the new Apple TV **will initially still require logins to cable networks to unlock content** [emphasis added].

I guess a first step into the realm of cable industry disruption is better than no step at all.

Gurman continues:
>According to our sources, the software update that enables Apple’s cable-replacement service is currently planned to also become available for the third-generation Apple TV. **However, the current model will not receive support for the upcoming App Store, nor will it be directly controllable by Siri** [emphasis added].

So while you can keep your Apple TV 3 and still experience the eventual cable industry disruption, you won't get any of the new features.[^resale]

Apple has announced an event for [September 9][apple], where we hope they'll shed some light on these long-standing Apple TV rumors. 

[^resale]: I was going to suggest preparing your Apple TV 3 for resale on eBay/Amazon. However, with a $69 MSRP for the current model, I'm not sure it would be worth it for you to resell your old one. Might be a better option to keep it around as a spare, or perhaps as a [traveling companion][boardingarea]?
