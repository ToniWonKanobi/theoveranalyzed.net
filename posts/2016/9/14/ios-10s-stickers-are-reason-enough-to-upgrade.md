Title: iOS 10's Stickers Are Reason Enough to Upgrade

Description: While the Unicode Consortium discusses emoji proposals in the most bureaucratic way possible, designers are releasing their own "emoji," and these might be better than regular emoji anyways.

![Yes, there's a Porsche-themed Sticker pack üá©üá™][1]
<!-- {.border} -->

I've been using iOS 10 since the first Public Beta landed this past summer. [As I've said before][2], this release seems to be a step in the right direction for iOS---Apple has restored some of the visual affordances that were starkly stripped away in 2013 with iOS 7.

That said, [Stickers][3] caught me completely off-guard.

Like, Take My Money Right Now&trade; off-guard.

Hearing about it at WWDC is one thing. Actually playing with them and using them in Messages---that's something else.

Since Stickers developers started offering packs on the App Store yesterday, I think I've already dropped nearly $10.

Here are some of my favorite packs so far:

1. [Star Wars][4]

	![They're like GIFs!][5]
	<!-- {.border} -->
	
	No well-rounded iOS 10 Stickers collection would be complete without some animated Star Wars characters.

2. [Alto's Adventure][6]

	![üê™ (‚¨ÖÔ∏è Not a llama emoji)][7]
	<!-- {.border} -->
	
	Who doesn't love Felipe? This set is available for free, and comes packaged with the latest update for Alto's Adventure, 1.4.

3. [Snacks][8]

	![These look good enough to eat.][9]
	<!-- {.border} -->
	
	This pack is from [Parakeet][10]. Some of them might look familiar, because [Louie Mantia][11] and [Alexa Grafera][12] have been creating delicious-looking illustrations for a while.

4. [Pixel World][13]

	![Retro indeed.][14]
	<!-- {.border} -->
	
	The Iconfactory released [several Stickers Packs][15] on Wednesday, but this is my favorite. I love the retro vibe; it's very reminiscent of [BitCam][16].

5. [Automoji for Porsche][17]

	![Can you tell which Sticker Pack is my favorite?][18]
	<!-- {.border} -->
	
	I was wondering if there would be a Porsche-themed pack, and lo and behold: a [Porsche Motorsport][19] [retweet][20] alerted me to this set by [Kevin McCauley][21].
	
There's bound to be more in the upcoming weeks.

If you haven't already climbed aboard the iOS 10 train, do so now.

Stickers alone make it a worthwhile upgrade.
