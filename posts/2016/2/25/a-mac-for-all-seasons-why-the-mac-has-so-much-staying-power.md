Dan Moren, for Macworld:

> I also can’t discount the power of emotion. I love my Macs—always have. And despite the fact that I carry my iPhone with me everywhere I go, I’ve never quite developed the same attachment

I couldn't agree more. I use my iPhone all throughout the day, and it's great.

But it's not my Mac.

I've experimented with an all-iPad setup a couple times in the past ([recently][2], I might add).

And as great as iOS 9's multi-tasking is, the iPad is not my Mac.

Maybe it's the \`old soul\` nerd inside of me. I'm not sure.

But I don't feel *truly* able to compute without my Mac.
