![I'm \*so\* going to watch this tonight.][1]

Chris Ryan and Sean Witzke at Grantland did a nice retrospective / Q&A on the past 20 years of Michael Mann films.

Here's Ryan on everyone's favorite, [Heat (1995)][2]:

> Itâ€™s one of my top two or three favorite movies ever made. Probably one of the most thrilling experiences Iâ€™ve ever had in a movie theater, and it has one of the greatest set pieces ever filmed. I remember it also as a reprieve from some of the more postmodern tendencies a lot of genre movies had adopted after Reservoir Dogs. There is no bluffing happening in this movie.

I first watched <i>Heat</i> during my freshmen year of college. The movie came highly recommended by a guy who lived down the hall. I remember him describing the movie as "realistic," saying that the sound of gunshots and explosions were *not* overdubbed (Mann wanted to keep them as startling as possible).

See for yourself (watch with headphones):
