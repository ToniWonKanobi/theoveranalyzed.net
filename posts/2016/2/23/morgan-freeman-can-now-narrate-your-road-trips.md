!["Want a cold one, Andy?"][1]

Ethan Anderton, for /Film:

> Various GPS systems have adopted plenty of famous pop culture voices to deliver audio directions

> Last year the navigation app Waze [added Arnold Schwarzenegger to their line-up][2], but theyâ€™ve hit the jackpot with their latest addition.

I've liked Freeman since I watched [The Shawshank Redemption][3] as a kid. Tim Robbins was the "main character," no doubt. But Freeman stole the show.

Tangentially related, I actually use the male British voice for Siri (and Maps directions). I feel terrible admitting this, but I hate the female Siri voice with a passion. And it's not because I have some chauvinistic dislike for a female giving me directions. 

No, it's just that I associate her voice with **all of her annoying past failures.**

And it's not like she hasn't had time to learn my voice. I've been talking to her her for over three years.

##### 2012

Me: "[Presses and holds home button] Set a timer for four minutes."

Siri: "I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Can you repeat it?"

##### 2016

Me: "Hey Siri, set a timer for four minutes."

Siri: "I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Can you repeat it?"

I'm positive that if it were Morgan Freeman failing me on a daily basis, I'd hate his voice too.
