![Atom + Operator = ❤️][1]

A few weeks ago, the fine folks over at [Hoefler & Co.][2] released [Operator][3], their first fixed-width offering.

The typeface is actually split into two main font families: the fixed-width Operator Mono, and the variable-width Operator. (From there, there are obviously Hoefler & Co's signature Multipurpose and "ScreenSmart" (SSm) variations.)

I've had Operator Mono SSm deployed across all of my websites since it was released, and I've been using it on my local machine in Atom, TextEdit, Byword, Terminal (!), and other places where fixed widths are appropriate.
