![Welcome back, low travel keyboard that I actually prefer over the old one][1]

It's been a while since I've written about my adventures without a MacBook.

<b>TL;DR:</b> I have a MacBook. (Again.)

### I Returned the iPad Air 2

If [Mark Gurman][2] is right, the Air 3 should be out in less than a month. No sense having a [years-old iPad][3] when the new one is just around the corner.

### Back to the Retina MacBook

I'm typing this post on my new [Retina MacBook][4]. Why did I get this MacBook *again*, especially considering that it [can't drive a Thunderbolt Display][5]?

Because of [this][6].

Indeed, the HydraDock is a [Kickstarter][7] project that actually came to fruition. Should be shipping at the end of February.

"But wait," you ask.

"The HydraDock couldn't possibly allow the [USB-C][8] MacBook to transverse connectivity technologies and talk to the Thunderbolt-based Thunderbolt Display."

This is true.

But what the HydraDock *does* allow is for the Retina MacBook to talk to the ~5-years-old Apple [LED Cinema Display][9] (ACD, hereafter).

And *that's* why---as I type this---I'm looking at a NOS 27" Apple Cinema Display sitting on my desk.

### Apple LED Cinema Display

Yes, there are still a few around.

And yes, it's *not* Retina.

But you know what it *is*?

It's a big ol' screen from Apple. Therefore, it is well made, and it will hold its value. Moreover, it's the *only* modern-ish big display from Apple. Yes, I could get a higher resolution display from Dell or LG (I've discussed this before), but I don't want to. If for no other reason, those display just look terrible.

üëåüèø

Somewhat fortuitously, I ended up with *two* ACD's. One brand new, and one with a single dead pixel that's completely obvious, but that doesn't matter. I'll tell you why. Once Apple releases new MacBook Pro's with Retina MacBook hardware, I'll get one of them, and then run *both* (!) ACD's. I can see it now: left screen for the browser and code apps, right screen with The West Wing reruns in another browser window.[^1] Who cares about a dead pixel? (Of course, the fabled standalone 5K Display that just *must* be coming---its unveiling will likely make these ACDs \`once-and-for-all\` obsolete. But until then, I ‚ù§Ô∏è them.)

#### The Future

I'm sure there will be another MacBookless adventure sometime soon. For instance, *if*/when Apple announces a new MacBook Pro lineup, there will probably be some time in-between announcement and availability. So I'll likely need some time to sell this MacBook in preparation for the new Pro's. At that point, I'll just use an iPad only (again).

[^1]: Why am I calling it "the browser?" After all:
	```js
	var toniBrowser == safari("duh")
	```
	
	and 
	
	```js
	var toniBrowser !== chrome("totes")
	```
