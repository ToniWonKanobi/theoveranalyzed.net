Daniel Jalkut, on OS X's "Smart Subsitutions" (e.g., replacing \`dumb\` quotes like `"` with smart ones like `‚Äú`):

> It‚Äôs a good thing.

> However, the feature can be vexing when typing in contexts where typographic beauty is clearly not the priority. For example the behavior would not make sense in a code editor like Xcode or BBEdit. These apps are more often used to write text that will please a programming language compiler or interpreter, where a string for example must be enclosed by "straight quotes", and ‚Äúsmart quotes‚Äù would only lead to a syntax error.

As Jalkut notes later, disabling substitutions system-wide *is* the easiest fix. But it's also akin to using a sledgehammer to hang a small canvas on the wall. Doing so would mean apps such as Tweetbot won't---[for better or for worse][1]---replace double/triple dashes and/or dumb quotes automatically.

So what does Jalkut suggest?

> Thanks to the flexibility of Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúuser defaults‚Äù system for registering preferences on a system-wide and app-specific basis, you can impose override preferences for these options on the specific apps of your choosing.

And if you hate the command line:

Ah, the ol' `Edit` ‚Üí `Substitutions`.

It's disheartening to know just how many things I've learned over the years, only to forget them later (üë¥üèæ?)
