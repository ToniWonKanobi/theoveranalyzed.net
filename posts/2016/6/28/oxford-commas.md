![Commas are our friends][1]

I remember when [tomatoes weren't a fruit][2].

I also remember when [cursive][3] was important.

I can *even* remember when it was customary to place [*two* spaces][4] following the punctuation of a sentence.

What I can't seem to remember is when exactly [Oxford (serial) commas][5] became uncool.

I don't think it was when the Associated Press published their [Stylebook][6] discouraging their use "before the conjunction in a simple series."

It might have happened when young designers decided that all punctuation was out, and said design trends trickled down to the masses.[^1]

That said, what's even less clear than *when* Oxford commas fell out of preference is *where* they came from in the first place.

Vox has some thoughts:
