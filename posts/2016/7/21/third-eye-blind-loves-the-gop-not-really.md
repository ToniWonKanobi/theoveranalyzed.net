![Silly GOP. You really should step off that ledge.][1]

Sean O'Neal, for the A.V. Club:

> Jenkins—a bit of a policy wonk who’s previously expressed interest in political blogging—has made no secret of his distaste for the Republican Party

> [He] capitalized on his captive audience at a charity gig inside the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame Museum, telling them he “repudiates” the GOP and chastising them with calls for tolerance and science—and in the biggest fuck-you of all, playing mostly new stuff.

> In one clip, amid random boos and catcalls, Jenkins introduces “Jumper”—“a song about acceptance and tolerance from a friend who jumps off a bridge because he was being bullied because he was gay”—by reminding the audience that “the RNC has still not, to this very day, been able to incorporate LGBT Americans fully, like my cousins who are gay, into the American fabric.” He then goes on to tell them that “to love this song is to take into your heart the message and to actually have the feeling to arrive and move forward and not live your life in fear [not] imposing that fear on other people.”

Their new[^1] stuff really *is* terrible.
