A couple days ago, designer Luke Wroblewski [tweeted][2] an image that made the rounds on "designer Twitter." I've embedded the image above, where Wroblewski compares the ultra lightweight UI of iOS 7 with the *relatively* more weighty iOS 10.

Wroblewski's tweet caught the attention of John Gruber, who [linked][3] to it on Daring Fireball:

> This is the sort of thing that takes years of refinement to achieve. It wasnâ€™t feasible for a 9-month project like the iOS 7 redesign to debut with this level of refinement.

He's right about the first part: there was no way the designers working for Jony Ive could've gotten it right in the 9 months they spent on iOS 7. I imagine that it would take *much* longer than just a few months to craft a cohesive and consistent UI worthy of the <iOS 6 successor.

That gets at the heart of the issue: Apple rushed iOS 7, and iOS suffered because of it.

What Apple's designers did in 9 months was just a *start*. What was released to the public in 2013 as the grand design evolution of iOS wasn't even a beta, figuratively speaking---it was an alpha at best. It's now some three years later, and for the most part, iOS [10] *still* isn't what it should be. Again, [it's a good *start*][4], yes, but it's not up to the level of software quality for which Apple is known.

It's so tempting to give Apple pass in this area, because iOS 10 really *is* better designed than iOS 7-9. The Apple apologist in me says, "Things take time."

But that's not an excuse. Apple should have taken the time to perfect iOS *internally*. Perhaps after spending ~three years toiling away in their all-white design caves, they could have released the [flattened][5] iOS when it was ready, not when [Wall Street][6] thought iOS 6 needed a refresh.

Instead of making a *big* splash in 2016, when everyone might have praised Apple for doing the Apple thing and [taking its time to perfect the beat][7], they succumbed to external pressures, and [took the quick and easy path][8]. iOS 7 was more than the annual update to the most important operating system ever---it was a message.

And the message wasn't one Phil Schiller would have been proud of. Instead of conveying Apple's careful attention to detail, iOS 7 suggested the opposite: it said that Apple *wasn't* careful, and it showed that Apple *wasn't* concerned with the details. And that's a shame, because that's not the Apple I know.
