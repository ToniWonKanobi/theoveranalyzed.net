![The crawl is a defining feature of the entire movie series (From Wookieepedia)][1]

Ethan Anderton, for /Film:

> Speaking with [Entertainment Tonight][2] on Friday after the panel at Star Wars Celebration, here‚Äôs what Kennedy had to say about the potential for a Rogue One opening crawl:

>>‚ÄúYou know, we‚Äôre in the midst of talking about it, but I don‚Äôt think these films will have an opening crawl. I think that‚Äôs what we kind of telegraphed at the beginning of the event today.‚Äù

I can understand why Lucasfilm might want to do without the opening crawl for the [anthology films][3]. After all, those films are *not* supposed to be about the central Skywalker/Solo family storyline, so why artificially connect these new stories to the past ones? It's a valid argument.

Still, I can't help but feel that to remove the crawl would be a *big* mistake. The opening crawl *is* Star Wars. I can't even think of another movie that uses that iconic crawl.[^1] [Not having the 20th Century Fox fanfare][4] at the beginning of [The Force Awakens][5] was already jarring enough.

[Don't go breaking my heart][6] (üé∂), Lucasfilm.

[^1]: I know George Lucas didn't invent the concept, but the imagery is so iconic, I doubt many would have a problem with me attributing the crawl to him.
