![Such a great character (Image from The Weinstein Company)][1]

Collider's Adam Chitwood, quoting Quentin Tarantino:

> “Landa is the best character I’ve ever written and maybe the best I ever will write. I didn’t realize [when I was first writing him] that he was a linguistic genius.”

I didn't watch [Inglorious Basterds][2] when it was released in 2009. When I did finally see it a couple of years ago, I was blown away with Christoph Waltz's portrayal of Hans Landa.

In the beginning of the movie, when Landa is first beginning his interrogation of the French farmer, he speaks French. Halfway through, he switches to English. And throughout the film, we're get sprinkles of Waltz's native German (he's fluent in all three languages).

I can't imagine anyone else having both the chops and panache to portray Landa as Waltz did.
