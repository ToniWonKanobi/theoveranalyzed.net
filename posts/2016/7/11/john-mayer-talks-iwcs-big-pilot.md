![5002 or bust.][1]

Before I saw [this][2] video, I had no idea John Mayer was into watches (I also had no idea what HODINKEE was).

That was over two years ago.

Today, Mayer was back[^1] on HODINKEE for a second video, this time talking about the Big Pilot in particular.

I've always thought that the "bigger" Pilots from IWC looked better than their newer, smaller ones. However, I'm afraid my wrist is too small to ever wear a Big Pilot how it's supposed to be worn---on the wrist, not the forearm.

Still, I enjoyed watching Ben Clymer and John Mayer review the Big Pilot lineup over the past 14 years.

[^1]: He's had a few other [features][a] on the site, but this is only his second video interview.
