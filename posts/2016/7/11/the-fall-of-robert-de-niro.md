![The Fall of Robert De Niro (From James Chapman)][1]

A few days ago, I stumbled on an interesting tweet from James Champan, in which he plotted all of Robert De Niro's films on an XY scatter plot. It seems that from about 2002 onward, all of De Niro's movies were terrible.

De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway in [Goodfellas][2] was such a masterpiece of a role that it seems impossible for him to have ever matched it (let alone top it). That's probably my favorite role of his.

Required De Niro:

1. Goodfellas
2. The Godfather, Part II
3. Heat
4. Casino
5. Jackie Brown
6. The Score (if you're desperate)

Whatever you do, stay away from his [romantic comedies][3].
