[Speaking of][1] Rebels, the official trailer for Season 3 of Star Wars Rebels landed today.

<iframe style="border-radius: 0.2em" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xmXp802sFgQ?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Surprisingly, they didn't skimp on overall trailer length: it's a full 3:32 long!

My first watch-through, I spotted what appeared to be [Outrider][2], [Dash Rendar's][3] Corellian freighter from [Shadows of the Empire][4] lore.

![Could it be?][5]

Moreover, several frames later, we see a behind-the-back POV shot of someone who seems to be gruff and Rendar-like---or, dare I say---Han Solo-like?

![Has to be Dash Rendar or Han Solo, right?][6]

If either of these guesses of mine are true, this would mark the first bit of SOTE storyline to become canon in the [new][7] Star Wars Universe.

More pessimistically, I distinctly remember the [trailers][8] for Season 2 of Rebels being more exciting that the whole of the actual season, so there's that. Some amount of mid-season slump is expected.[^1] Here's hoping it's better this time around, compared to last Season.

[^1]: Occasionally, the same is true for whole series. Why do you think it is that middle 3-4 seasons of the Game of Thrones television series really seem to drag on and on? The creators for the TV adaptation of George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy tale had to basically wait around for entire seasons in order for Martin to finish the next installments.
