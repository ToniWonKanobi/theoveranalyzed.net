![So small (From Nintendo)][1]

From the Nintendo press release:

> The classic NES is back in a familiar-yet-new form as a mini replica of Nintendo’s original home console. Plugging directly into a high-definition TV using the included HDMI cable, the console comes complete with 30 NES games built-in, including beloved classics like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Donkey Kong, PAC-MAN and Kirby’s Adventure.

I can't help but wonder whether Nintendo plans to offer a *Super* Nintendo Classic Mini? I grew up playing [Super Mario World][2] and [Super Mario RPG][3] (likely my favorite video game ever), so you can imagine my waxing nostalgic at the thought of a cute little mini-SNES.

I'm sure these'll be flying off the shelves come November.
