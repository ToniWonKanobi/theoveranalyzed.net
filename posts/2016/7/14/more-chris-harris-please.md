![We want more of this, please.][1]

Here's the breakdown of what's been happening with Chris Harris lately:

1. He joined BBC's revamped Top Gear for [this past season][2]
2. The show sucked, mostly because it [focused on idiots][3] instead of actual drivers/cars like Harris
3. BBC [knows this][4].
4. BBC offered up [Extra Gear][5]â€”likely to appease Top Gear viewers who care more about motorsport than TV show personalities
5. [Fans loved it!][6]
6. BBC knows this.
7. BBC further embraced Harris with a [new series][7] entitled "Chris Harris on Cars," which is---if you remember---the same name of a [YouTube channel][8] [Neil Carey][9] put on for Harris

So, if you want to watch Chris Harris, there's Extra Gear, and then  revamped Chris Harris on Cars, now on BBC America. The former is on [iTunes][10], but alas, the latter is not. (Thanks BBC America ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) Hopefully it will be at some point, otherwise it's a no-go for us cord-cutters.[^1]

[^1]: That is, unless you have a family member who's not a cord cutter ðŸ˜‰
