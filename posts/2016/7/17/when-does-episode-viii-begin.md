![No gap? (From /Film)][1]

Ethan Anderton at /Film has some details on Rian Johnson's <i>Episode VIII</i>. Specifically, when it takes place in the timeline of the Star Wars Universe:

> ### When Does Episode VIII Begin?
>
> Even though this was something that was assumed and somewhat [confirmed back in February][2], we now know for certain that <i>Star Wars: Episode VIII</i> begins just after the final shot of <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>. That means this will be the first Star Wars movie that doesnâ€™t feature an extended passage of time between the end of the last movie and the beginning of the next one.

If this is true, that would indeed be a first for a Star Wars movie, as Anderton notes. Still, there's never such a cliffhanger as what was left at the end of <i>The Force Awakens</i>. Therefore, <i>Episode VIII</i> beginning immediately after the final shot in the previous movie makes a lot of sense.
