![Native bash on Windows (From The Verge)][1]

Chris Welch, for The Verge:

> Microsoft is reaching out to Linux developers in a way that the company never has before. "The Bash shell is coming to Windows. Yes, the real Bash is coming to Windows," said Microsoft's Kevin Gallo on stage at today's Build 2016 keynote. The announcement received an uproarious applause from the crowd. The new functionality will be enabled as part of this summer's Anniversary Update to Windows 10.

I don't operate in the Windows environment, but if I ever have to in the future, it will be nice to use the [bash shell][2] natively.

```bash
$ rm -rf ~/previous/roadblocks && mkdir "hell hath frozen over"
```
