![I like these a lot.][1]

Last week, a [post][2] by Marco Arment showed up in my RSS feed with the headline "The new headphone king: B&O H6 (2nd generation)." The content of said post was B&O Play BeoPlay's second generation of high-end [consumer] headphones, the [H6][3]:

> And even though the first-generation Bang & Olufsen BeoPlay H6 had been my top pick for a long time, I‚Äôd lost faith in their recent headphone efforts, having been very disappointed by the H6 DJ Khaled Edition, wireless H7, and on-ear wireless H8.
> 
> But the new H6, distinguished simply by ‚ÄúH6 (2nd generation)‚Äù on the box, **blew me away** [emphasis added].

> Upon any physical inspection between the first and second H6, you‚Äôll think nothing has changed.
>
> Until you hear them. **They sound, quite simply, awesome** [emphasis added].
>
> The original H6 also sounded awesome, with only a few caveats: the bass was a bit light, the midrange was a bit bumpy, and they needed an amp to sound their best at higher volumes.
>
> The H6 ‚Äú2nd generation‚Äù has **solved every shortcoming of the original H6** [emphasis added]

Before I could even finish the article, I had another Safari tab open, this one focused on the Amazon page for those cans. (I also [linked][4] to his post.)

I purchased the H6's immediately, happy the delivery date quoted was going to be two days in the future.[^1]

Well, Thursday came (a day before previously quoted delivery date), and no shipping notification from Amazon.[^2] Concerned that my precious headphones weren't going to arrive by the weekend, I checked the order history, which said they weren't going to be delivered until Tuesday. Somewhat perturbed, I then spent about an hour chatting with <s>an Amazon rep</s> several Amazon rep's, each of which told me that not only were the H6's *not* going to be delivered by Saturday, they also weren't going to be delivered by Tuesday (what the Order History section said). In fact, they probably wouldn't ship for at least 1-4 more weeks.

<!-- Wasn't that cool? -->

Fast-forward to this past Tuesday, and by some miracle, I finally got those H6's.

And you know what?

Marco was right.

*These are noticeably different from the first generation.*
<!-- {.takehome} -->

It still sounds like a \`treble-head\` set of headphones, but unlike the first generation, there's more bass.[^3]

Is it Beats-level bass? No! (That's a good thing.)

While the H6 was always well-balanced, it's relatively straight-forward treble response occasionally left me wanting in the bass department. If I had to chose, I would choose treble over bass, because I like hearing treble detail.

But now I don't have to choose.

[The 1975][5]'s [latest effort][6] makes for a nice testing bed for these new cans.

	"Two days in the future" fell on a Friday---a perfect start to the weekend, right?

	Keep reading.
[^2]: If you're of those people who---like me---scoffs when privileged first-world people complain about first-world problems, you might want to skip the next few paragraphs.
[^3]: I sometimes thought to myself that the first generation H6 had *less* bass than EarPods, which, if true, would be crazy.
