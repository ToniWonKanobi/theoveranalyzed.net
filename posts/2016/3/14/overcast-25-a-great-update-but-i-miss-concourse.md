[Today][1], Marco Arment pushed a major [point?] update to Overcast, featuring a new Dark Theme, file uploads, and better iPhone speaker volume (among other things).

### Dark Theme

The Dark Theme is my favorite addition to version 2.5:

![I think I hate Apple's San Francisco typeface][2]
<!-- {style="border: 0.2em solid lightgray;"} -->

My only problem with Overcast's new Dark Theme is the removal of [Concourse][3], the tightly-tracked sans-serif Marco used in Overcast since it's launch.[^1]

Your browser does not support the video tag, probably because it sucks.

It's not that I dislike Apple's San Francisco---I just appreciate well-chosen \`craft\` typefaces more than stock ones.[^2]

According to a tweet, Marco removed Concourse because he thought it didn't look as good with the Dark Theme:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FAQ: Why not offer options for SF font in light mode or orange tint in dark mode?<br><br>I tried both and thought they simply didn’t look good.</p>&mdash; Overcast (@OvercastFM) <a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM/status/709505284012687364" title="Permalink to tweet">March 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

Fair enough. It's his app! He can do what he wants.

Still, I'm with this guy:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM" title="Overcast on Twitter">@OvercastFM</a> perhaps consider it an option, like <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetbot" title="Tweetbot on Twitter">@tweetbot</a> ( :</p>&mdash; Ａｎｄｒｅｗ ᗧ · · ᗣ (@iamMrDom) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamMrDom/status/709505695847096320" title="Permalink to tweet">March 14, 2016</a></blockquote>

### Uploads

Overcast 2.5 also features Uploads.

I was excited to try this.

You see, ever since Overcast launched, I've been spoiled. I find it hard to listen to podcasts (or audiobooks) at 1x---it's just too slow for me now.

I've had this audiobook version of Tim O'Brien's [The Things They Carried][4], narrated by Bryan Cranston.

What a perfect way to try out Overcast 2.5's uploads, right?

First, I located the file:

![Thanks, right-click menu][5]
<!-- {style="border: 0.2em solid lightgray;"} -->

Then, I navigated to <https://overcast.fm/upload>:

<figure>
	<video controls autoplay loop title="Uploading The Things They Carried" style="border: 0.2em solid lightgray">
  		<source src="/movies/overcastupload.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag, probably because it sucks.
	</video>
	<figcaption>So close.</figcaption>
</figure>

After that, I should have been ready to go.

Except this is what I saw when I tried to play the file:

![Sigh.][6]
<!-- {style="border: 0.2em solid lightgray;"} -->

What was the problem?

Digital Rights Management (DRM), that's what.

![Figures.][7]
<!-- {style="width: 100%;"} -->

I should have read Marco's post more carefully:

> The new Uploads feature lets patrons upload **DRM-free** [emphasis mine] audio files

So, it seems that because audiobooks aren't a part of iTunes Match, they're still DRM'd.

It was worth a try!

### Better iPhone Speaker Playback

> I’ve developed a separate Voice Boost profile for the iPhone speaker, which boosts volume even further than before while dramatically reducing real-world distortion and harshness, especially with the phone on a flat surface.
>
> It’ll never sound like a great full-size speaker — you can’t beat physics — but it’s significantly improved for podcast listening.

I've been wanting this for a while. I frequently drive around with my iPhone in the cupholder. I point the speaker toward the bottom of the cupholder, which tends to amplify the sound from the phone.[^3]

***

All in all, Overcast 2.5 is a solid update. I just hope Marco adds an option to use Concourse for the new Dark Theme---San Francisco is way too unopinionated for such an opinionated app.

[^1]: Concourse's creator is none other than Matthew Butterick, a guy whose extensive work with typography caught my attention [a few months ago][a].
[^2]: This is the reason why in my layouts, [Avenir][b] is always the fallback typeface for sans-serif situations. It's a lot like Helvetica or San Francisco, but it's different-enough that I don't get sick of it after a few seconds.
[^3]: This tends to work better than placing the iPhone with the speaker facing me. Doing so usually results in a muddled sound, especially when the window's open.
