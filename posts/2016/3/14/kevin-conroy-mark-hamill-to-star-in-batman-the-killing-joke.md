![Batman: The Killing Joke (From Mark Hamill's Twitter)][1]

Brett White, for Comic Book Resources:

> "The chance to work once again with Kevin Conroy, my favorite Batman, in what some consider the definitive origin of this iconic villain is a dream come true for me," Hamill said in a statement to CBR. "I am beyond thrilled to return as The Joker in 'The Killing Joke!'"

Indeed, Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill truly are the definitive voices for the animated versions of Batman and The Joker, [at least for comic fans of my generation][2].

Looking forward to [this summer][3].
