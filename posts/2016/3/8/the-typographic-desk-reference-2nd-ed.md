![The Typographic Desk Reference, 2nd Ed.][1]

> The second edtion – with a foreword by Erik Spiekermann – has over doubled in size, the specimens have been reclassified to modern standards, and the index (now 1/6 of the book) has been deeply cross referenced, allowing you to – among other things – find the glyphs required for a particular language.

(From [Hoefler & Co.][2])[^1]

[^1]: I haven't bitten the bullet with Jekyll yet, which means I haven't registered a domain, which means I haven't even *begun* to work on my \`front end dev\`-focused website.

	I *do* have a bunch of articles saved, and I'm ready to post about / link to them, but the site's not ready yet.
	
	So, until then, I have to break my "no front end dev topics" on TheOverAnalyzed rule.
