Andreas Tsaousis, for Carscoops:

> Having followed in the footsteps [...] of Hollywood legends like Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, the ex-Grey’s Anatomy actor also doubled as a racing driver.
>
> Since 2004, Patrick Dempsey has competed in 68 races, including taking part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times

> [In] 2015 he scored his best-ever result at Le Mans, finishing second (along with Peter Long and Marco Seefried) in the GTE Am class in a Porsche 911 RSR and winning the FIA World Endurance Championship race at Fuji.
>
> Last year wasn’t all good news, though, as he departed from the hit TV show that earned him the nickname “Dr. McDreamy” and his 16-year marriage to Jillian Fink ended. The pair has since reconciled, and now he’s decided racing has taken a back seat to other priorities.
>
> “At this point in my life, after an amazing season thanks to my friends at Porsche and TAG Heuer, I need to take a step back and focus on both my family and my acting career”, said the 50-year old actor.

It's hard to read between the lines here.

For whatever reason, I recently started watching [Grey's Anatomy][2].[^1] I'm somewhere in the middle of the third season, and although the show is chalk-full of nonsensical drama, I haven't gotten far enough along to understand why McDreamy was killed off last year (did his death make sense for the show, or was it hastily written-in for non-obvious-to-the-viewer reasons?).

Was it because he wanted to keep racing? Or was it something else?

Also, the demise of Dempsey's Derek Shepherd sure *seems* to coincide with his split with wife Jillian Fink.

Likewise, I don't follow the Le Man series closely enough to make an informed guess as to why Dempsey is now leaving racing.

Whatever the reason, this much is true: just as was the case for the aforementioned Newman and McQueen, Dempsey's dabbling in racing was a fun time for casual racecar fans like myself.

#### Update: Patrick Dempsey: The Timing Just Seems Right

April 2, 2016
<!-- {.updatetime} -->

Patrick Dempsey, for [Racer][4], on his decision to leave full-time racing:

> The timing just seems exactly right, in the Heuer way. Not too soon, not too late

> Will I race again? At this moment I can't say for sure. I'm very comfortable with my decision to walk away from competitive driving, although I hope to sneak away for a test day or two to keep my skills up

[^1]: I'm perfectly happy to admit that I have embraced my \`not-at-work-life\` in which I watch Netflix for hours and clean the house.

	I wish I could be a stay-at-home toni all the time.
