Stef Schrader, for Black Flag:

> The biggest news of the day wasn’t the pleas for fans who were burned by last year’s miserable weekend to return. It was the addition of T-Swift to the schedule as a huge Saturday night infield concert.

Older fans of F1 are not to worry, though: prices should be *lower* this year, rather than higher. Here's Schrader, again:

> If you’re worried about Taylor Swift fans (and/or yourself) being priced out of the weekend, one other promising note came out of today’s announcement: prices will be lowered.

I'm not sure how any amount of star power---even the likes of which that flows from Tae---could save F1 from it's decreasing attendance.
