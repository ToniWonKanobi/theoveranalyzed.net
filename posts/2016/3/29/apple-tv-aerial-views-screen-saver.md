![Tired of Ken Burns? (From John Coates)][1]

Here's a neat find: an open-source repository for the new Apple TV 4 screensaver.

I've seen mention of these before, but this is the first fairly plug-n-play solution.

[Best part][2]:

<!-- {Used vanilla HTML for the second-level heading because `markdown-it-anchor` saw the `##` in the markdown source -->
> <h2>Features</h2>
> * **Auto Load Latest Aerials:** Aerials are loaded directly from Apple, so you're never out of date.

Nice.
