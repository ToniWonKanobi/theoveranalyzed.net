I [*still*][3] haven't made my front-end-focused website, so, in the meantime, I'll have to share this here.

CSSKetch.

It's a plugin for Sketch that allows users to design programmatically (you know, with CSS/Sass/Less).

Most front-end designers are \`designers-first, developers second.\`

So, the workflow for *most* web designers is as follows:

1. Design pixel-perfect mockups in Photoshop/Illustrator/Sketch
2. Find web developer
3. Give pixel-perfect mockups to developer
4. Wait.
5. Get proposal back from web developer
	1. Designs aren't pixel-perfect, because the web is hard
6. Get mad. Send mockups back to developer.
7. Hope for the best.
8. Wait.
9. Get discouraged. DIY next time (takes longer, but whatev's).

There are, however, a few web designers who were \`developers-first.\`

Unlike the conventional designer, some web designers design---get this---*right in the browser*.

Their workflow is like this:

1. Have text editor open, with necessary HTML, stylesheets, and JavaScript
2. Have web browser open
3. Write code in text editor
4. Observe changes auto-refreshing in browser
5. Done.

Put plainly, there are some web designers out there who are more comfortable with code, and less comfortable with conventional design applications.[^1]

*CSSKetch is for those people.*

Want to apply a particular shadow, gradient, border---whatever---to more than one element in an artboard (or to an artboard itself?). It's easy: just apply a class `.class` to the necessary elements.

No more copy and pasting to mimic styles.

Whenever I get around to making that design-focused website, I'll be sure to take a good look at this plugin.
