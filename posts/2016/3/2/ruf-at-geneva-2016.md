Description: RUF is at Geneva 2016, and they brought some 964's and at least one 993. (Who needs a 911 R, anyways?)

![The 964 was (is) such a great platform.][1]

EVO is at Geneva (obviously).

What is not so obvious is that [RUF][2] is *also* at Geneva 2016, showing off some pretty neat air-cooled-era 911's.

[I specifically shared this to counterbalance my [previous][3] post ðŸ˜˜]
