Some bald guy,[^1] for Carfection (previously known as XCAR), on the new 911 R:

> [There] is a problem with [the 911 R].
>
> And that problem is the purists. Because the purists, well, they want the same thing they'v always had.

> The problem with the purists is that, well, they---like me---can't afford to buy new cars---especially cars like this.

> So what manufacturers have done is they've geared their new cars towards the people who actually can afford to pay for them when they're new, rather than the used market.
> 
> **And those people---a lot of them just don't care about the purity** [emphasis added]

And that about sums up the decades-long trend of \`pure\` sports cars slowly disappearing.

[^1]: I really did try to find his name. But, alas, like a lot of multi-person YouTube channel teams compromised of nameless presenters, "bald guy" was the best I could do.
