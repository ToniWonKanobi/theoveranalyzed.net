Andrew Cunningham, for Ars Technica:

> [Today, Apple] is releasing the first of many Safari Technology Preview builds, a new development snapshot of the browser designed to show off more features while offering more reliability and stability than the nightly WebKit browser builds.

I love this new Apple.

Moreover, as [John Gruber][2] notes, since these builds are signed by Apple, users will have iCloud Tab Syncing---a feature not available in the WebKit Nightlies.
