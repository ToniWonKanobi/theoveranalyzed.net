John Mayer, for Hodinkee, on the new Daytona:

> To me, and to an existing Daytona owner, this is like a software update to your iPhone. Every time you download a new update you're not having a new experience with your iPhone, you're having a new experience with whatever is updated and new, and so I think that's the difference here. We are experiencing the bezel, and the black sub-dial rings. After that, it's the same watch we've owned.

The "bezel" to which Mayer speaks is the black Cerachrom bezel---new for this reference---which as Benjamin Clymer [notes](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-new-rolex-daytona-reference-116500ln-details "Clymer's first take on the newly announced Daytona reference 116500LN"), is the only *real* differentiator between this 116500LN reference and the 116520 it replaces. Still, what a differences it makes. 

My recent infatuation with [motorsport](/2016/4/18/2016-long-beach-grand-prix-iwsc "My post on the Long Beach Grand Prix") seems to have blossomed into a keen interest in mechanical watches. While the fabled "[Paul Newman](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/reference-points-the-paul-newman-daytona "Hodinkee piece on the Paul Newman Daytona's")" Daytona's are all but unobtainable for mere mortals like myself, this new-for-2016 reference takes us *that* much closer to the best vintage Daytona's---there's even a "[Panda](/images/daytona6263.jpeg "Link to Panda dial from Hodinkee")"-ish dial on the new reference!
