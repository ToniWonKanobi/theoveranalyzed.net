![It's time to Trump the Bern Great Again (From Fast Company][1]

Zach Leatherman, for Fast Company:

> Bernie Sanders was the one candidate who had a font-loading strategy (using TypeKit). Donald Trump was the one candidate who tried to have a font-loading strategy but it ended up being more bravado than actual results. Hillary Clinton had no font-loading strategy.

This piece is largely non-consequential as far as true politics is concerned, but it's fun for typography nerds. Leatherman also refers to Trump as "racist, a misogynist, and a horrible human being," so that's interesting.[^1]

[^1]: Likewise, he refers to Hillary's Panama-based CDNs (for her webfonts). Interestingly, Leatherman had nothing snarky to say about Bernie.
