True fans will immediately notice that the first half of the title sequence features imagery from the trench run (decidedly more [Star Wars][1] than [Empire][2]), and even truer fans will notice Luke's "[Jedi][3]" all-black entire as he falls through space. Neither really fit here, but this video is nonetheless a remarkable piece of work.

I agree with [Gruber][4]---they really should have chosen the Radiohead song instead of Sam Smith's.[^1]

[^1]: Perhaps they did so because at the time, Sam Smith was [is?] more popular than Radiohead.
