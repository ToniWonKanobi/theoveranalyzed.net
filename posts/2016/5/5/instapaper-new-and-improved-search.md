For months now, the existing search infrastructure had been stretched to its current limits. In order to continue scaling and implement a lot of the features you’ve been requesting, we needed to completely rebuild our search infrastructure.

In the past, searching for a saved article in Instapaper has been less than ideal. Oftentimes, it couldn't even match a query string whose contents were literally in the title of a saved item (e.g., searching for `devour prince` wouldn't actually lead to results for a saved Devour post that had `prince` in the title).
