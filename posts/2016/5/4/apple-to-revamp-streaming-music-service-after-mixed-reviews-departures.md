From Alex Webb, Lucas Shaw, and Adam Satariano of Bloomberg:

> Apple is altering the user interface of Apple Music to make it more intuitive to use, according to people familiar with the product who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. Apple also plans to better integrate its streaming and download businesses and expand its online radio service, the people said. 

> As iTunes sales stagnate and rival Spotify continues to draw in new subscribers, Apple is attempting to reclaim its dominance in music.

> But the combination hasn’t yet fulfilled its potential.

> Following a management shakeup, the service’s new look is being overseen by content head Robert Kondrk and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor. Design chief Jony Ive's team also has provided input, along with Iovine and Eddy Cue, the senior vice president in charge of Internet services.

> Rogers’s departure last August was particularly troubling for many on the music team. A skateboarder who got his start in the industry by building a website for the Beastie Boys, he was seen as being able to strike the delicate balance between creative artists and engineers. In a display of affection for Steve Jobs, he has a tattoo of the NeXT logo on his leg.

There's a lot to unpack from this piece, but the gist is that Apple has [hopefully] realized Apple Music was basically a beta when it was released. It was so terrible that it managed to [piss off even the most ardent of Apple fans][2].[^1]

I'm hoping that Apple uses this opportunity to fix iTunes (e.g., break it apart like on iOS, with separate apps for Music, and Videos, TV Shows, etc.). I've written about this [before][3], when Eddy Cue hinted as much in his podcast appearance on [The Talk Show with John Gruber][4].

##### Turn Off Apple Music on iOS

If you want to turn off Apple Music on iOS, you can do so using [Restrictions][5].

Here's a screenshot:
