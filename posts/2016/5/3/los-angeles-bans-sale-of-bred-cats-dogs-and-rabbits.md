Anna Starostinetskaya, for VegNews:

> The Los Angeles City Council recently voted 12â€“0 to ban the commercial sale of all non-rescued cats, dogs, and rabbits. A temporary ban on bred animals was in place in the city since 2013 and set to end on June 30. However, on April 20, council members voted to reinstate the ban permanently. The ordinance encourages city pet stores to hold adoption events for rescued animals and instead make their profits from companion-animal supplies.

While this doesn't stop the **private** (i.e., "traditional breeder's") sale of bred animals, it *does* go a long way to stop the **commercial** sale of animals at pet stores.

Bravo.
