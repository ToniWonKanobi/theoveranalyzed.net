![Sad.][1]

[Speaking of][2] Twitter, here's Ingrid Lunden for TechCrunch:

> Twitter has quietly retired [Magic Recs][3], a strikingly effective bot account that used to send you DMs recommending viral accounts or Tweets to follow, run by an algorithm that measured how many others you knew were following an account or Tweet in quick succession.

> Magic Recs was the first and perhaps the best known of Twitter’s DM-based notifications, but there were others. Another Twitter experiment built on the same premise — [Event Parrot, for news alerts][4] — also is no longer sending DMs.

I remember [Event Parrot][5].

> Doubly ironic is the fact that Magic Recs was a bot that actually worked when [some][6] have flopped.

Yeah, this.

Sigh, Twitter. Sigh.
