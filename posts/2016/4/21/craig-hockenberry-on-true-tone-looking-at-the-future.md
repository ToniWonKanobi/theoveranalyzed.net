Craig Hockenberry did a rundown of the True Tone display on the new 9.7" iPad Pro:

> Over the coming years, displays that only show sRGB are going to feel as antiquated as ones that can only display @1x resolution.

> After using this iPad for a couple of weeks, I’ve realized it’s like the advances of Retina in an important way: I never want to use a lesser display again. And as with higher density, I think it’s obvious that Apple will eventually update all its products to use this improved screen technology. I can’t wait!
