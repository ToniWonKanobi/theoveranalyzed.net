![Elago R1 Intelli Case (From Tools & Toys)][1]

One of the biggest gripes I've heard concerning the [Apple TV 4][2] is the remote's design. [John Siracusa][3] has often complained that picking up the remote haphazardly (like normal people do) often results in accidental[^1] and inadvertent activation of the touchpad. If the Apple TV is already on and playing content, this typically results in an irritating fast-forward, rewind, or pause/play command.

The Elago isn't perfect, but it certainly helps.

The case has grippy \`ends\` that allow holding the remote in a more ergonomic position. And because of the way the bottom of the case covers the bottom of the remote, it's easier to orient the remote correctly before picking it up fully, theoretically leading to less accidental commands.

I'll be getting it (from [Amazon][4]).
