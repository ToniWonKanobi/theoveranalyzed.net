From the V-dog blog:

> For starters, one of the biggest misconception among dog lovers is the idea that dogs are carnivores. According to a study by the [University of Maine][2], "The dog is a subspecies of the grey wolf as Canis lupus familiaris, and classified in the order as Carnivora. Despite public belief, the dog is in fact not a true carnivore; **the dog is an indifferent omnivore**...This means that dogs have carnivorous traits with sharp teeth and meat drive, but also have the omnivore digestive traits with an ability to break down carbohydrate feeds."

> Through evolution, dogs gained the ability to digest and utilize starch 28 time more effectively than wolves through the AM2BY gene.
