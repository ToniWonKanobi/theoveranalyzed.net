I've linked to this movie [before][3]. And I've long thought that the best part of [Interstellar][4] was the first half to the movie. I thought it was genuinely emotional (and great) up until the whole \`old-lady-Murph\` part. (That such ridiculousness was pointed out by the After Credits video warms my heart.)

After Credits is a new collaboration between Screen Junkies ([Honest Trailers][1]), and the team behind [How It Should Have Ended][2].

They don't have their own playlist (yet?), but if/when they do, I'll be subscribing.
