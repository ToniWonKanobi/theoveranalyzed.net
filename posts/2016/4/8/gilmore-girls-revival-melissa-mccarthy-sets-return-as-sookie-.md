![Sookie's coming back (From NBC News)][1]

Michael Ausiello, for TVLine:

> After months of will-she or won’t-she speculation, Melissa McCarthy has agreed to reprise her role as Sookie in Netflix’s forthcoming Gilmore Girls revival

> McCarthy is set to make the news official on Friday’s Ellen (scroll down to watch clip). “I’m going to go back and do it,” she enthusiastically told DeGeneres. “[Series creator] Amy Sherman-Palladino is going to squeeze me in to do it. I’m very happy to go back to Stars Hollow.”

While I don't think [Gilmore Girls][2] would have been completely lost without her, it's nice to know she's back.[^1]

[^1]: She was never my [favorite character][a], anyways.
