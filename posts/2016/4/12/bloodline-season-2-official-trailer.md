I enjoyed Season 1 of Bloodline quite a bit.

<details class="spoilers">
  <summary class="spoilers-tagline">Spoilers</summary>
  <div class="spoilers-content">
  
  However, that the show's strongest character, Danny Chandler (portrayed by [Ben Mendelsohn][2]), was killed off at the end of the first season didn't exactly leave me hopeful for a worthwhile season 2. I guess we'll have to wait and see.
