![This looks so dumb.][1]

Casey Newton, for The Verge, with a sampling of quotes that make me think Newton doesn't actually appreciate good design:

> So fresh and so clean

Really? Fresh and clean? How about "white and stupid?" Yeah, that's more like it.

> Of all the major social platforms, Instagram has evolved the slowest.

Yeah, 'tis better to innovate terribly than to never innovate at all, right?

> The result is a design that feels more modern, but also perhaps less distinctive than the current version of the app.

Perhaps.

I can't wait to read what Eli Schiff has to [say about this][2]?
