*This will be a short one, because I'm toying with making this a sort-of `microblogging` post, and because I forgot my Magic Keyboard upstairs.*

My MacBook Pro made the quick journey home this past Saturday. And if my [previous post](/2016/1/18/macbookless-part-ii-a-preview "My previous post discussing my then-looming time away from a Mac[book]") was any indication, I had planned on returning this iPad and restoring my MacBook Pro and going on with life as usual.

However, curiosity got the better of me.

I'll post more later (have to get ready for work),[^1] but here's the gist of it:

1. **I've decided I might like the iPad.**
2. **I've decided that I might want a Mac Pro.**

![Good question, John](https://d.pr/i/9yu4+ "'Why?,' indeed")

Check back later.
