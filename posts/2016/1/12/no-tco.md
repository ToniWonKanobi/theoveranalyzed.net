![no t.co][1]

Ever since [Tweetbot 2 for Mac][2] [launched][3] a few months [back][4], I've been experiencing this annoying "bug" (feature?) in which `t.co` links do not resolve in Safari.

In the spirit of `rdar://`:

* Steps to Reproduce:
	1. Launch Tweetbot for Mac or have it open
	2. Click `t.co` link
* Expected Results:
	1. Launch Tweetbot for Mac or have it open
	2. Click `t.co` link
	3. Switch to Safari to view new tab/window
	4. Note content in Safari tab/window
* Actual Results:
	1. Launch Tweetbot for Mac or have it open
	2. Click `t.co` link
	3. Switch to Safari to view new tab/window
	4. Note **lack of content** in Safari tab/window
* Regression:
	1. Tweetbot version 2 and newer

Luckily for everyone, [Dan Loewenherz][5] has a fix, and it's free on GitHub via his public [repository][6].

You could either clone the repository and have some fun on your local machine, or just download the prepackaged version.

Goodbye, annoying `t.co` links---I won't miss you at all.
