![Anthony Craig, DDS is live!][1]

It should come as no surprise to you that I am not a full-time web designer/developer.[^1] And despite what appears to have become a bonafide [theme][2] of this blog, I don't just sit around all day, reading articles about <i>The Force Awakens</i>.[^2]

No; in the real world, my J-O-B job is that of a professional tooth carpenter. In the more common vernacular, a [dentist][3] ðŸ˜·

About a month ago, I was going through a transition time with my work situation. Through that, I realized that for all my constant [fiddling][4] with my *personal* blog, my *professional* persona had no "official" online presence (unless you count [Twitter][5], of course).

How would patients find me if I left one office for another?

I needed a website. 

I thought about doing something [similar to what I have done][6] with TheOverAnalyzed: a static blogging engine hosted/deployed via [Heroku][7].

The only problem with that is that I didn't know (and still don't know) enough about JavaScript to tweak Casey Liss's core [Node.js app][8] to remove all the "blog-aware" features of his engine.[^3]

Initially, I asked Casey if it would be easy to tweak Camel into being more static-y and less blog-aware than it current was. His reply was that doing so would be difficult.That was unfortunate, because I liked having command line control over my blog. It's certainly a lot faster than using a [traditional][9] [CMS][10], and it's just plain nerd-cool.

Still, Camel wasn't an option for my dental website.If not Camel, what? What else was out there?I asked Casey:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss">@caseyliss</a> know of something thatâ€™s a blank slate like Camel? (Not Squarespace or WordPress or another CMS?)</p>&mdash; Anthony Craig (@ToniWonKanobi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToniWonKanobi/status/678940837317750784">December 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/ToniWonKanobi">@ToniWonKanobi</a> github pages?</p>&mdash; Casey Liss (@caseyliss) <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/678942844170715136">December 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

Up until asking Casey, I had no idea [GitHub Pages][11] existed.

I'll detail in a future post how I got my dental website up and running via GitHub Pages.

Until then, head on over and check it out: <http://anthonycraigdds.com>

[^1]: (Duh). I'm embarrassed to note that if my website were a public GitHub repository, you'd find the commit log---chalk full of commit messages like "fixing CSS"---would be close to 1100.
[^2]: Not that I wouldn't mind doing so ðŸ¤“
[^3]: Why would I want to do that? Well, I don't plan on blogging as Dr. Anthony Craig all that often (mostly because dentistry isn't really that interesting to non-dental people). So all the nifty blog-aware stuff Casey has written into Camel would be lost on my dental website.
