![/now is all the rage right now][1]

Have you ever browsed a blog's `/about` page, hoping to find meaningful information about the author, but instead of finding something neat, you only found something like this:

<i>"Graduated from Pacific Union College in 2009 with a degree in Chemistry"</i>

And after finding information similar to the above, have you ever then thought to yourself, "Gee, I wonder what the author is doing more *recently*?"

ðŸ¤”

Yeah.

I don't think I've wondered that either.

But apparently [Derek Sivers][2] *has* wondered such thoughts.

He started the "/now" movement in mid-2015, and since then, it's sorta-taken off.

Basically, a `/now` URL slug should take a reader to a page on one's site that has a little more personal information than what's to be found on the `/about` page.

So, instead of:

<i>"Graduated from Pacific Union College in 2009 with a degree in Chemistry,"</i>

the `/now` page might contain something more like this:

<i>"My wife is almost done with school and I have a 6-year-old donkey"</i> 

(Or something to that effect.)

At first I thought this was kind of silly. 

And, truthfully, I *still* think it's silly. That said, I added a `/now` page for kicks.

Go check it out: [`/now`][3]
