![Yes, but does it howl like a real GT3?][1]

This is pretty cool.

Porsche doesn't say so explicitly, but based on a few choice specs listed, it seems this soundbar is crafted from a 991 GT3 exhaust:

> From 0 to 100 in 3.5 seconds. **Up to 9,000 revolutions per minute** [emphasis added]. Top speed of 315 km/h. These are just numbers to some people â€“ for us, they are notes in a symphony of the sports car: the sound of the Porsche 911 GT3.

Any [Porschephile][2] worth his salt will know that the only GT3 with a 9,000 rpm redline is the 2013+ GT3 (or the [991][3] generation for nerds).

Here's what I'm wondering:

Can we buy the exhaust-on-a-pedestal without the audio stack---afterall, the GT3's exhaust is pretty enough by itself.
