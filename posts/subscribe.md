# Subscribe Via Email

Congratulations! You've made it to the super-secret corner of my site that contains information regarding email subscriptions.

While most nerdy folk will subscribe to the site via Twitter or RSS, most of my family and friends are not that nerdy. To accommodate their non-nerdy tendencies, I have created a MailChimp newsletter connected to my alternate RSS feed. If you subscribe to this email, MailChimp can push out daily updates with new posts from TheOverAnalyzed.

I have struggled with email subscriptions since starting the site in 2014. Originally, I was all for it, since I figured it would be better to include non-nerdy people by default. However, my plans were thwarted when I realized that, at least according to MailChimp, my email campaign would be subject to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. In a nutshell, this would have required me to list my actual home address (since TheOverAnalyzed is not a business with its own business address). That was something I was just not comfortable with.

So what's changed? Nothing, really. I don't plan to use my actual address in the bodies of MailChimp's emails. It's just that I don't care about MailChimp's blind subscription to the CAN-SPAM Act. The Act was meant to curb spammers who so often masked nefarious intentions with tons of misleading text and flashy HTML graphics. That's not what I'm trying to do. I'm not selling anything. My blog is just for my rants, and sharing other people's rants. If that doesn't jive with MailChimp, whatever. Come at me MailChimp. 

Since moving to Casey Liss's Camel, I have a built-in 'permalink RSS feed' of sorts. This [alternate RSS](@@SiteRoot@@/rss-alternate) feed contains linked entries pointing back to my site (in lieu of their targets). This was a great basis for the newsletter feed, since the same people put off by Twitter and RSS are probably the same people put off by the idea of a Linked List.

Here's the signup:
