<p>There might be other examples, but in tech the most well-known example of this strategy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock">Intel&#8217;s CPU schedule</a>: one generation is a new microarchitecture (big new change) and the next is a shrinking of the previous one. What isn&#8217;t obvious is that the &#8220;tocks&#8221; are the new microarchitectures, and the &#8220;ticks&#8221; are the die shrinkings. So for iPhones, the S models are the ticks, and the new form factors are the tocks. That seems counter-intuitive, of course, because we say &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; but the tocks come before the ticks. That&#8217;s kind of stupid if you ask me, so if you want to call the new form factor models the ticks and the S models the tocks, go right ahead.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2015-09-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>
