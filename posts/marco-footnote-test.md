			<p>I could stretch this analogy indefinitely. The menu only has brief and vague descriptions of the entrees, you&#8217;re forced to eat two pounds of bland mashed potatoes before you can enjoy your steak, the &#8220;steak&#8221; turns out to be reheated meatloaf, the waiter stops you between every few bites by shoving a different entree from a completely different restaurant in front of you and asking if you&#8217;d like to buy it as well, and glancing at these offerings automatically adds them to your bill, which turns out to be $1300 before the required 50% gratuity, and nobody told you that there were hidden cameras recording your every move for detailed analysis by fifteen creepy guys from the moment you pulled into the parking lot, even when you were picking your nose in the bathroom.&#160;<a href="#fnref:p3t1EQitu1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
