Title: Broken Links  
Description: This is the page I've dedicated to broken links that I just cannot seem to redirect.  

Despite my best efforts, several of my posts since TheOverAnalyzed was on Squarespace were simply not redirectable.[^1] 

Here are permalinks to those posts:

* [Christians [Not] Acting Like Christ][1]
* [Why I Couldn't Handle The iPhone 6 Plus][2]
* ["The Last American Who Knew What The F*** He Was Doing"][3]
* [Zoos][4]
* [How To Clean Up Your Twitter Feed][5]
* [Fantastical 2][6]
* [First Post Ever][7]

[^1]: Trust me, I tried. [A bunch][a].
