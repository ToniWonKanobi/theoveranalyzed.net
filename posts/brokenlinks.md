<h1>Broken Links</h1>

Despite my best efforts, several of my posts since TheOverAnalyzed was on Squarespace were simply not redirectable.[^tr] 

Here are permalinks to those posts:

* [Christians [Not] Acting Like Christ][chr]
* [Why I Couldn't Handle The iPhone 6 Plus][theoveranalyzed]
* ["The Last American Who Knew What The F*** He Was Doing"][theoveranalyzed 2]
* [Zoos][theoveranalyzed 3]
* [How To Clean Up Your Twitter Feed][theoveranalyzed 4]
* [Fantastical 2][theoveranalyzed 5]
* [First Post Ever][theoveranalyzed 6]

[^tr]: Trust me, I tried. [A bunch][d].
