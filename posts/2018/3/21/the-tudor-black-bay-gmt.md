![From HODINKEE: The new Tudor Black Bay GMT (79830RB) ü§§][1]

At this year's Baselworld, Tudor [unveiled][2] it's Black Bay GMT---a first for the Black Bay lineup.

As Stephen Pulvirent of HODINKEE notes, the bezel is something special. It's got this "soft, matte finish," which is unlike the [Cerachrom][3] bezels on Rolex's current GMT-Master II lineup. I think it's more subtle than the Cerachrom bezel; more confident.

I am 95% in love with this watch, except for a few details. And these are the same two details I've disliked on all the Black Bays since 2016:

1. Loss of the Tudor "rose" emblem on the dial, and a switch to the more modern "shield" emblem
	* Tudor's first series of ETA-powered Black Bays featured Tudor's original rose emblem---a nod to the 16th-ish century English dynasty that was the [House of Tudor][4]
	* [Tudor did away with that when they started using their own in-house manufacturer movement][5]
	* That's too bad, because the rose emblem was neat üåπ 

2. Riveted bracelet
	* From 2016 onwards, Tudor started using a riveted bracelet instead of the non-riveted ones of the previous years' Black Bays 
	* While "period correct," I think the riveted bracelet is too masculine
	* This is Tudor, the perpetual[^2] little brother to Rolex. These watches aren't supposed to be masculine (üö´üí™üèº)---they're supposed to classy	
		* Tudor/Rolex is like Porsche. Both have long histories and famous offerings. Just as you won't ever see a 911 with blown V8 poking out of the front hood, we really didn't need to see a Tudor with rivets in the bracelets

While this new Tudor GMT *still* has the shield emblem, and it *still* has a riveted bracelet, it looks like a real winner for the brand.

Priced at [CHF 3,700][6], this is an absolute *steel* of a deal compared to Rolex's GMT-Master II lineup.[^1]

[^1]: By the way, Rolex unveiled a new GMT-Master II today as well: a [GMT-Master II with "Pepsi" bezel and Jubilee bracelet---in stainless steel!][a] (üò±)
[^2]: Things are changing, though. More and more, Tudor seems to be [embracing its role][b] as the Rolex that Rolex could never make. Tudor can take chances with its offerings---Rolex can't.
