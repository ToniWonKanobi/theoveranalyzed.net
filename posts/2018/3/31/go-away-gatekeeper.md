### What is Gatekeeper?

Apple introduced [Gatekeeper][2] "Wikipedia entry for \"Gatekeeper\"") in [Mac OS X Lion][3]. Gatekeeper prevents users from accidentally opening applications that aren't from the Mac App Store, as well as applications from non-Apple-signed developers.

Users can get around the block by secondary clicking the application and invoking the Context Menu `Open` command.

This additional step forces users to *explicitly* acknowledge that they're about to open something Apple hasn't at least indirectly approved.

In the ~6 years since its implementation, Gatekeeper hasn't had that much of an impact on my computing life. At most, it's a slight annoyance once in a while. But I always figured my small irritations were worth it if it helps prevent a disaster for the novice computer user.

And that's really what Gatekeeper's about: it's a feature that's aimed *squarely* at the less technologically savvy amongst us. You know---grandparents and the like.

### Gatekeeper: Front and Center

Gatekeeper didn't mean that much to me until this past weekend, when I was forced to deal with it's incessant dialogs.

This past weekend, while having the [greatest hamburger experience ever][4], I also visited a Leica retailer to try the M (Typ 240). Ever the M rangefinder, the M240 has no real way of determining the aperture of the lens. It *does* try and approximate it, though. Trouble is, the approximation is usually off ¬± 1 stop.

Therefore, all the EXIF data for those pictures shot on the M240 had incorrect aperture values üòí Unsurprisingly, this irks me a great deal.
	
All was not lost, though. All of the lenses I tried with the M240 were [6-bit coded][5], so I could tell from EXIF data which shots were taken with which lens. Also, I knew what aperture I used with each lens---∆í/1.4 with the [Summilux 50mm][6], ∆í/2.0 with the [Summicron 50mm][7], and ∆í/0.95 (üò±) with the [Noctilux 50mm][8].
	
Armed with that information, I knew what corrections needed to be made in the EXIF data for those M240 shots.
	
Problem: there's no easy way to edit the aperture EXIF data with any of Apple's built-in apps.

I had to download this ancient and quasi-broken (though beloved by many) [non-Retina] application called [pyExifToolGui][9], which is a GUI wrapper for a CLI utility called [`exiftool`][10].

And guess what happened when I tried to open the utility:

![Dialog box that pops up when trying to install an app that Apple hasn't previously condoned][11] <!-- {figcaption:.hidden} -->

Sigh.

After getting past this initial roadblock, I had to download something else (I forget what exactly), and when I tried to open *that* application, there was *another* stupid dialog. Long story short: this happened several times over an hour period.

It was exhausting.

I had the idea that I should check System Preferences to see if I had somehow un-selected the "Allow apps downloaded from [Anywhere]" setting:![This is a screenshot of System Preferences "Security & Privacy" tab, before disabling Gatekeeper][12] <!-- {figcaption:.hidden} -->

Turns out: I hadn't somehow accidentally selected a less permissible option in that Security & Privacy tab. In macOS Sierra, Apple *removed* the ability for power users to select the "Anywhere" setting. 

This madness had to end.

### Disabling Gatekeeper

"Google is your friend."

It took less than 5 seconds of searching to find [this solution][13]:

```bash
$ sudo spctl --master-disable
```

This \`superuser do\` command is setting the "[SecAssessment system policy security][14]" to \`disabled\` mode---allowing apps to be installed from anywhere.

Now, when I try to open that same utility, I get *this* dialog:

Sure: still annoying, but at least I don't have to do the right-click-`Open` dance anymore. I guess Apple can't make it *too* easy for power users üôÑ
