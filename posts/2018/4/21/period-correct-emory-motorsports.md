By this time tomorrow morning, [#Luft5][2] will be in full force, and I'll likely be [FOMO][3]ing from the couch in my living room üò¢

![Porsche's aplenty][4]

So, in honor of my missing out, I thought I'd link to an impromptu Luft-ish event that happened *last* weekend: the launch of a new apparel line that was a collaboration between Period Correct and Emory Motorsports.

[Period Correct][5] is a Southern California clothing company dedicated to Old Car‚Ñ¢ culture. The building they currently occupy was the location of an old Porsche parts shop called [Parts Obsolete][6]. The owner of said shop was Gary Emory, and his son, Rod Emory, runs [Emory Motorsports][7]---a company who makes some of the most tricked-out 356 [Outlaws] out there.

![It was neat/affirming to see that a few people were inspecting #TONI964's interior üèÖ][8]

![Jeff Zwart's dog was so cute!][9]
