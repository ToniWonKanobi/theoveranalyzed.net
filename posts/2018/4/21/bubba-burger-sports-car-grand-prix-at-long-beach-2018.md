Last weekend I took a drive down to Southern California for the Long Beach Grand Prix. More specifically, I was going to attend the IMSA race on Saturday.[^1]I've written about the Long Beach Grand Prix [before][1], and this year was no different. There were plenty of sights (👀), smells (👃🏻), and sounds (👂🏻) to be had---the event was a complete sensation overload 😵

[^1]: IndyCar doesn't really appeal to me, but "sports car" racing does❗
[^2]: Yesterday, the [news broke][a] that flickr was bought out by SmugMug. I'm not really sure what this means for the service. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I just got into [flickr][b]---a good ~5 years after its heyday ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

	As my Instagram has slowly become a cesspool of advertisements and Facebook-esque unimportance, flickr has been a nice escape.
	
	And for a recent camera nerd such as myself, flickr is quite powerful. I have subscribed to and bookmarked several groups, such as [this one][c], which is comprised of images from my next (🤞🏻) lens: the Leica Summilux-M 50mm 1.4 ASPH.
