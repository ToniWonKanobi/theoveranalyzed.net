Apparently, yesterday was the 10th anniversary of one of the funniest episodes of [The Office][2]: "The Dinner Party."

To commemorate the occasion, Rolling Stone published an [oral history of the episode][3], with interviews from several cast members including John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer, as well as episode director Paul Feig,[^1] and show-runner Greg Daniels.

I've written about The Office [before][4].

That post almost three years old, and in the time since writing it, we've probably re-watched <i>The Office</i> 3-4 times. While that may seem crazy to you, know this: I could watch this show over and over again. It's my happy place.

The first time through, <i>The Office</i> was for me what it is for most people: laugh out loud funny. Steve Carell is just an incredibly funny guy to watch.

You may have stumbled upon [casting sessions][5] during the early stages of the show. Several other actors tried out for the part of Michael Scott. And while I'm sure the other actors would have done a decent job portraying the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, nobody else could have been Michael Scott as well as Carell. [Perhaps to his disdain?], Steve Carell *is* Michael Scott.[^2]

But my subsequent viewings of <i>The Office</i> were more nuanced. Sure, the show is a comedy. There's no changing that. But there are *also* some really heartfelt moments that sort of get glossed over the first time through.

Remember "Business School," when Micheal goes to Pam's art show?

![Get's me every time üò≠][6]

Or what about the time when David Wallace apologizes to Michael for his involvement in Jan's deposition?

![We love David Wallace!][7]

Or in "China," when Dwight feels sorry for Pam and gets her to [lets her] force him to raise the office standards?

![üíö][8]

Watching it the second time through, especially, it was clear to me that <i>The Office</i> wasn't *just* a comedy: it also had some tender moments that endeared me to the show.

For me, the super funny episodes and story arcs are eclipsed by the emo/family motifs. But I'm just a softy, I guess üòè
