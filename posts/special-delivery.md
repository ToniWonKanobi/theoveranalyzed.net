Eight years ago today, we went on [our first 'big' date][d]

❤︎❤︎❤︎

Years later, it isn't *that* date I remember best  
It's [all the small ones that followed][d 2]

❤︎❤︎❤︎

It's hard to put to words [my feelings for her][d 3]

❤︎❤︎❤︎

I never knew what true love was before her  
Without her, [I don't think I could ever know it again][d 4]

❤︎❤︎❤︎

Over the years days have gone by  
And the monotony of life has gotten the better of me  
Causing me to forget [just how special she is][d 5]

❤︎❤︎❤︎

Still, every evening I walk through that door  
Only to find the most [wonderful and exquisite creature][d 6]  
Waiting for me on the other side

❤︎❤︎❤︎

That never gets old

❤︎❤︎❤︎

She's the one with whom [I have shared everything][d 7]

❤︎❤︎❤︎

And best of all, we have [so many more years ahead of us][d 8]

❤︎❤︎❤︎

I love you Allison
