Eight years ago today, we went on [our first 'big' date][1]

***

Years later, it isn't *that* date I remember best  
It's [all the small ones that followed][2]

***

It's hard to put to words [my feelings for her][3]

***

I never knew what true love was before her  
Without her, [I don't think I could ever know it again][4]

***

Over the years days have gone by  
And the monotony of life has gotten the better of me  
Causing me to forget [just how special she is][5]

***

Still, every evening I walk through that door  
Only to find the most [wonderful and exquisite creature][6]  
Waiting for me on the other side

***

That never gets old

***

She's the one with whom [I have shared everything][7]

***

And best of all, we have [so many more years ahead of us][8]

***

I love you Allison
