# Nerd

In addition to using a [forked version](https://github.com/DataMcFly/camel) of Casey's engine, I have employed several additional open-source JavaScript tweaks, [Bigfoot](http://bigfootjs.com) (for fancy footnotes), and [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com) (for auto-width `<iframe>` content). Both are relatively lightweight, and should render quickly in most modern browsers. You should check them out.

## Useful URL Slug Stuff

[/2015/](/2015) for a list of all posts during the year of 2015[^p]

[/tags/](/tags) shows all tags[^t]

[/live/](/live) for coverage of live events like [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/)

[^p]: You could similarly do something similar for [2014](/2014). And you even get more specific than that and list posts by year *and* month.
[^t]: You even get more specific than that and list posts having a particular tag (e.g., maybe you wanted to see every post having to do with [Apple](/tags/apple)
