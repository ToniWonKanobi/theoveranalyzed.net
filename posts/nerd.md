<h2>What The Site's Made Of</h2>

The site is built on a [forked version][github] of [Casey Liss][twitter]'s static blogging engine [Camel][github 2], itself based on the [Node.js][wikipedia] runtime environment.

All of the pages on this site are based on "[static][wikipedia 2]" [Markdown][wikipedia 3] files `.md` (see [below][theoveranalyzed]), which are converted to HTML non-dynamically. The later versions of Camel and it's forks use [Vitaly Puzrin's][twitter 2] [CommonMark][commonmark]-based parser called [`markdown-it`][github 3].[^mdinpm] I've also installed several additional [`markdown-it` plugins][mdipl]. First, there's [Val√©rian Galliat][val]'s [`markdown-it-anchor`][github 4],[^mdianpm] which makes for easy linking to specific headers like on GitHub. Also, I added [Oktavilla][oktavilla]'s [`markdown-it-table-of-contents`][github 5],[^mditocnpm] which allows for easy insertion of a table of contents with `[[TOC]]`. I wish it supported nested header levels, but [the developer doesn't seem interested][okt].

I have also employed a couple of indispensable open-source JavaScript projects. The first is [Bigfoot.js][bigfootjs] for fancy popup footnotes---first popularized by Marco Arment's read-it-later app, [Instapaper][marco]. And then there's [FitVids.js][fitvidsjs], which makes all `<iframe>` embeds responsive (i.e., it makes YouTube videos scale to the width of the horizontal container).
 
To the best of my knowledge, TheOverAnalyzed should perform well in most modern web browsers. For users of Internet Explorer version 6 and prior: my site might look weird in certain areas. Might I suggest an [alternative][google]?[^chrome]
