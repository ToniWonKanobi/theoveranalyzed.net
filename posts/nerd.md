Title: Nerdy Stuff

Description: This page contains additional information about the site not covered in /about  

### The Apps I Use

* [Byword][1] for static content such blog posts. I've tried plenty of other text editors---including the text editor in which I do all my front-end stuff---and they just never quite do it for me. Byword is by far my favorite for just *writing* text

* [<del>Atom</del>][2] for front-end coding and web design

	#### Update: Bye Bye, Atom. Hello Sublime Text

	February 13, 2018
	<!-- {.updatetime} -->

	I'm now using [Sublime Text 3][3] instead of Atom. The latter, being an Electron app, wasn't as performant as a true native app like Sublime Text. I switched a few months ago, and although I haven't really done any web design in a year, I like Sublime. It's as amenable as Atom, and it's definitely more snappy!

	</aside>

* [CodeKit][4] is a great utility for compiling [Sass/SCSS][5] down to "regular" CSS for the browser. It adds browser prefixes to declarations as well. I probably wouldn't use a CSS extension without an app like CodeKit to help me

### Technical Underpinnings of TheOverAnalyzed

* This site was built using [Camel][6], [Casey Liss][7]'s static-ish blogging engine
* Camel is a [Node.js][8] app utilizing several [node package modules][9] to make everything work together
* I actually used a [forked version][10] of Camel, and that fork included provisions for [tags][11] and a [sitemap][12]
* From there, I further-tweaked Camel with additional [`markdown-it`][13] plugins:
	* [`markdown-it-footnote-conventional`][14], which is my[^1] forked version of [`markdown-it-footnote`][15]. My fork changes a few tags from `<div>` to the more semantic `<section>`
	* [`markdown-it-anchor`][16], which generates `id`'s to all headings (for easy permalinking)
	* [`markdown-it-decorate`][17], which allows for easy `class` and `id` attribution on elements without making the Markdown source document ugly with HTML tags everywhere[^2]
	* [`markdown-it-highlightjs`][18] for code highlighting
	* [`markdown-it-implicit-figures`][19], which takes Markdown-style images and wraps them in `<figure>` with `<figcaption>`'s in the resultant HTML

### Hosting

* TheOverAnalyzed is presently hosted on [Heroku][20], though I often consider something *fully* static, like a-[Jekyll][21] setup

### DNS

* The domain name registration and DNS are through [Hover][22]
* I briefly switched to DNSimple to try out SSL, but it's so much easier when Hover does everything

### Media

* Before 2016, almost of the images and videos are served via [Droplr][23] embeds. This has always been sort of hacky, since Droplr never intended to support media embeds for grandfathered "Lite" users like me. I'll switch those out eventually
* From about 2016 onward, most all of the media on the site is self-hosted (`/images`), except big photos taken with my Leica, and/or `<video>` embeds (since they're so huge)

### Web Standards

* To my knowledge, TheOverAnalyzed should [conform][24] to [HTML5][25] web standards (üòÖ)
* And its [CSS][26] should validate as well (ü§ûüèº)
* If you find that an area of the site does not perform as expected, please [contact me][27][^3]

### Useful URLs

#### [Now][28]

* Ever want to know am I doing now? Think Twitter owns too much of the internet already? Check out the `/now` page. It's what [Micro.blog][29] was before Micro.blog existed üôÉ

#### [Tags][30]

* Tags help group similar posts together, and even if my readers care less about them, I use them often enough when referencing prior posts

#### [Livestream][31]

* When the stars align, I provide "coverage" (snarky commentary) of live events such as WWDC on Twitter

#### [Newsletter][32]

* Yes, I *do* have an email newsletter.

#### [Broken Links][33]

* Perhaps you've searched everywhere for a particular post, but *still* can't find a link you're looking for? If so, the post might be here

#### [Markdown Source][34]

* This is so cool. You can see how the sausage is made üå≠ Just can append `.md` to the end of any URL to see the actual Markdown source for that page[^4]
