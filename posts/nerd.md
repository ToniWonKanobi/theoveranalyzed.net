# Nerd

In addition to using a [forked version](https://github.com/DataMcFly/camel) of Casey's engine, I have employed several additional open-source JavaScript tweaks, [Bigfoot](http://bigfootjs.com) (for fancy footnotes), and [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com) (for auto-width `<iframe>` content). Both are relatively lightweight, and should render quickly in most modern browsers. You should check them out.
