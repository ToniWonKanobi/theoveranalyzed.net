It's been months since I played bass.[^1] When I first started, the most common reaction from my friends was this:

![I literally didn't know this reference when people first mentioned it to me][1]

But the *second* most common reaction was this question:

"Hey man, can you play the Seinfeld bass line?"

I got so tired of saying "No" that I actually learned how to play it---more or less.

But what people may not know is that no actual bass guitar played that iconic bass line. It was actually Jonathan Wolff---the composer for the Seinfeld theme song---playing the bass line on his *keyboard*!

This was a fun one to watch.

(Man, I really need to find that [bass][2] I want.)

(From [Uncrate][3])

[^1]: I actually sold my last bass because I was looking to purchase a new one, but that new one hasn't been available [at a price I like] for a while. So here I stand, currently bassless.
