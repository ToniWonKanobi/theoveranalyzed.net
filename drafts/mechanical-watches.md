I gave up on the Apple's watch a few months ago. And despite what you might think, it wasn't a particularly hard decision.

At the time, not even watchOS 2 could make the hardware-throttled experience much snappier. Indeed: what should have taken milliseconds took *whole* seconds---sometimes tens of them, when the task was particularly "complicated," like setting a timer.[^1]

It wasn't always this way. Like most Apple faithful, I stayed up late one Thursday night and preordered the Apple Watch because it was supposed to be game-changer. I wasn't plugged into technology as much when the iMac and iPhone launched (and I wasn't even born when the Macintosh landed!), so I wanted to be sure and be there for the Watch. It was Apple's first novel product in 5 years, and it's first after having lost Steve Jobs as its leader.

But after a better part of a year with the Watch, I was tired of it. It was too slow, and more importantly: I knew there was something better for my wrist.

And I knew that something didn't have an LCD: it had gears, instead.

Unlike my decision to ditch the Apple Watch, choosing which timepiece to adorn my wrist was much more difficult.

Quartz watches are a dime a dozen, but despite their ubiquity in today's watch world---especially in the <$500 market, where, funnily enough, is where the Apple Watch lives---quartz timepieces are almost always the best choice for extremely practical folks.

There's really no fussing with them: every 5-10 years, one has to replace the battery, but beyond that, they're usually pretty bulletproof. Wearers don't have to worry about magnetism or any of the other oddities that plague mechanical watches.

And there are even a few quartz watches out there that I'd like to add to my collection someday.

But my first nice watch wasn't going to be quartz, it was going to mechanical. Self-winding or automatic---it didn't matter to me. I just knew that I wanted to wear a watch that was assembled by another human.

The primary consideration when choosing one's first luxury timepiece is cost. Excluding all the smaller brands that many unofficial horologists espouse, and focusing instead on the top 10 most popular marques from Switzerland, cost can help differentiate the Submariners from the Daytona's, and likewise the Seamasters from the Speedmasters.

Notice that I didn't mention function.

Consider the former aforementioned pair of watches: the Rolex Submariner and the Rolex Cosmograph Daytona. The Submariner is about as simple of a watch that Rolex produces, one whose only complication is a date (and a lot of Submariner fans skip that one anyways). The Daytona, on the other hand, is a full-blown chronograph: it has sub-dials for stopwatch functionality, and it doesn't take tens of seconds to activate the stopwatch, either.

Somewhat arbitrarily, and also somewhat out of 

[^1]: I'm being facetious here, because setting a timer from the watch face complication shouldn't take tens of seconds.
