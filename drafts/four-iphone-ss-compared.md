Since 2012, I've bought every new iPhone as soon as I possibly could have (and for 2013--present, that meant staying up until midnight PST to do so). And every year, after getting said device, I open that recycled cardboard box with a level of excitement surpassed only by holding the actual aluminum and glass device therein.

But 2014 was different. That fall, I went from an iPhone 5S (the "S" was big back then)
