Hrishikesh Hirway of [Song Exploder](http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/2015/5/7/song-exploder-podcast-house-of-cards-and-downton-abbey) fame recently wrote a piece on [Medium](https://medium.com/@hrishihirway/entropy-unhappiness-and-the-gilmore-girls-cb57b46bd8bd), extolling the virtues of Gilmore Girls---but only the first five seasons.

I've written about [Gilmore Girls](http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/2015/5/5/the-office#gilmore-girls) [before](http://www.theoveranalyzed.net/2015/3/23/downton-abbey-ending-after-season-6), and since then, nothing's changed. I still like the show. But it took Hirway's straightforward assessment of the show to cause me to realize the indelible truth: Gilmore Girls sucked after season 5.

Here's Hirway:
>At the end of season five, Rory has gone from a model youth to an adulterer who wrecked a marriage, a college dropout with an arrest record, a mediocre journalist who is the beneficiary of nepotism despite her fierce belief in meritocracy, and generally become a whiny, complacent, ungrateful jerk. Over the course of her high school and college career, her romantic life went from perfect – dating Dean who, despite later retconning to be a bit of a dummy, starts off as a dreamboat who reads Hunter S. Thompson – to getting her heart stomped on by Jess’s inability to let go of his own idealized version of what reality should be, and then falling for Logan, who’s only kind of into her, and whose family thinks she’s basically trash. Worst of all, and devastating to the most central thesis of the show, Rory and Lorelai don’t even seem to like each other that much anymore. It’s so great.

Admittedly, my favorite aspect of the series is the chemistry between Alexis Bledel's Rory and Milo Ventimiglia's Jess Mariano. And even though their story continues with a few cameos into season 6, the better arc of the story ends before the show got that far.

After season 5, Rory begins dating an unlikable and snobbish rich kid, and the whole Luke/Lorelai love situation is tired and dull. It's not the same.

Nothing's ever the same.

Gilmore Girls isn't the only TV series that declined toward the end. Indeed, I will refrain from simply rehashing a previous post on the subject, and suffice it to say this:

<div class="takehome">

Most TV shows suck toward the end

</div>

With that said, here's what I've done. Part exercise in long-term memory, and part exercise in CommonMark table syntax, I've compiled a  list of all the TV shows I've watched, with scores for how much lameness each show endured over its lifetime.

The formula used to calculate the statistics is simple.

For a given TV show:

1. `x` represents the number of seasons for which the TV show sucked
2. `y` represents the total number of seasons
3. The ratio of `x` to `y` (`x/y`) represents the LameScore&#8482;

For instance, consider the aforementioned TV show Gilmore Girls. The show ran for seven seasons (`y = 7`), with only the final two seasons sucking (`x = 2`). Therefore, Gilmore Girls Suck Score&#8482; is thus: 

```
x/y = 2/7 = 0.28571 ≈ 29%
```
