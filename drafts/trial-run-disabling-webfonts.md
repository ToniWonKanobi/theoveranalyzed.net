Ever since I became more interested in typefaces and web design, Ideal Sans had been my unicorn. When I initially became interested in using the font on my website, I knew nothing about HTML and CSS, to say nothing about my lack of webfont knowledge in general. Marco used it for his blog, and Q Branch used it for Vesper. It's also available in the Feedbin webapp (along with other Hoefler originals like Whitney).

When I moved from Squarespace to Camel last month, one of the lights at the end of the tunnel was securing Ideal Sans for the website. I remember the first time I deployed my site and I saw that beautiful and personable typeface staring right back at me. I had done it.

I made a website. And I made it look good.

Over the course of the next few weeks, I was constantly tweaking this and that in CSS.[^no] Up until a few days ago, page load times were a rather trivial matter for me. From the beginning, I knew there would be no way to match John Gruber's lightning-quick Daring Fireball, which loads in approximately 1 second on desktop *and* mobile. Gruber has virtually no JavaScript extensions in use, and his website rarely features an embedded image. When it does, the size of the image is in the low hundred of kilobytes. 

Conversely, TheOverAnalyzed has always been a media-rich blog. I don't just write about nerd topics. Very often, pop culture posts can be found interspersed amongst the posts about static blogging engines. And when I do write about Star Wars or Legos, the posts usually include a picture or two. Also, because of the way Camel is written, a single generated page might have 10-15 posts. If each posts has one picture weighing in around 500 KB, that could add up to around 7-8 MB

[^no]: Nothing's changed. I don't think I'll ever be truly done with my website.
