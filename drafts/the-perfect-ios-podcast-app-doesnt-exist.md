![Three great iOS podcast apps: Overcast, Castro, and 'sodes‚Äînone of them perfect](/images/overcast-castro-sodes.svg "My cute little illustration with the three podcast apps I'm currently playing with")

I've been listening to podcasts since the end of 2012. It's an integral part of my media consumption workflow.[^1] I listen to podcasts on my commutes, I listen to them while mowing the lawn, I listen to them while doing laundry---I listen to podcasts more than I listen to music.[^2]

In the beginning, there was [Pocket Casts](https://play.pocketcasts.com/ "Pocket Casts"). Next, there was [Castro](http://supertop.co/castro/ "Castro"). And then there came [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/ "Overcast").

Overcast has been my [podcast app of choice since it was released](/2015/4/7/favorite-podcast-client-for-ios "Link to my post naming Overcast as my favorite podcast client") almost [four years ago](https://marco.org/2014/07/16/overcast "Marco's blog post introducing Overcast").

Overcast is *still* the podcast app that sounds the best to me. I can listen at greater-than-1x speeds without those annoying \'sped up sound\' artifacts plaguing the experience.[^3] Voice Boost helps make the voices louder (so that when I switch to playing music, my ears don't explode), And Smart Speed removes all the spaces in between people talking, so that I can get through podcasts faster.

I can't say it enough: **Overcast has the best audio.**

But does having the best sound make it the *best* podcast app? Does the best sound make it a *perfect* podcast app? (*Is* there a perfect podcast app?)

That's what's on my mind as I write this post.

### Overcast

Overcast is not an ugly app. On the contrary, it's rather nice-looking. There's plenty of color to had. Orange/white or Blue/gray: Overcast isn't just one big white `UITableView`, like so many apps have been post-iOS 7.

I'm neither a designer nor app developer---so what do I know---but my armchair opinion of Overcast is that it's very conservative in its design. You know what I mean: there are lot of rectangles, lots of thin weighted strokes, and lots of sharp angles (look at the "Play" button).

In his defense, when Marco released Overcast, this was the style! iOS 7 was still very much new and fresh. Textures were out. Gradients were out. Those little border radii on the corners of the app were gone.

In terms of iOS 7, Overcast is a good iOS citizen.

But it's 2018, and times have changed. I wish Overcast would take a few pages out of Castro's and 'sodes' playbook.[^4]

Marco *did* thicken-up some of the stroke widths with Overcast 3. But in my opinion, more could be done.

#### The Good

* Sounds the best of all three podcast apps and has the most robust audio options
* UI is clean and easy to understand

#### The Bad

* iOS 7-era design is old
* Animations are either stock vanilla `UIKit` or kinda-sorta jumpy

### Castro

As I mentioned previously, I used Castro for a few months in between Pocket Casts and Overcast. When it first came out, it lacked *any* audio tricks like Marco's Voice Boost, and speeding it up beyond 1x sounded as horrible as it does in Apple's Podcast app. But guess what? I used it because it was so dreamy.

The animations were fun, the iconography was rounded; it had the "Card UI" before Apple 

#### The Good

* Sounds great and has a few useful audio options
* More fun and whimsical than Overcast

#### The Bad

* Doesn't sound as good as Overcast (lacks a silence eliminator, etc.)
* Inbox/triage-style UI is not as easy to understand as the conventional "List of Podcasts / List of Episodes" paradigm

### 'sodes

#### The Good

* UI is Fun and Whimsey‚Ñ¢ to the max
* UI is simple and relatively easy to understand

#### The Bad

* There are no audio options
* There are no options in general

Ultimately, sadly, obviously: there really is *no* perfect iOS podcast app.

And although I'm tempted to relate the imperfection of iOS podcast apps with the reality that everything else in this world is imperfect, I won't do that. That would be defeatist.

We're not talking about solving world hunger. These are little bits of lit up pixels on baby screens that go in our pockets. Can we not do better!?

Should we really settle for 95% perfect?

I hope not.

Otherwise, ["What has all this been about? What have we been working toward?"](https://youtu.be/qBJFFpDwX1M?t=33s "One of Creed's best quotes")

[^1]: Is it an oxymoron to have a *media* consumption workflow?
[^2]: Although there are occasions when I'll listen to a podcast at the gym, I usually listen to music instead because it helps me stay focused.
	
	You know how some people will listen to music while working? I need that at the gym. I like the \`white noise\` of it all. When I've tried to listen to a podcast at the gym, I find that I'm paying more attention to the podcast than I am to working out.
[^3]: An interesting consequence of me frequently listening at ~1.5x is that whenever I watch a YouTube video or hear audio of a podcaster speaking in real time, they sound so slow! It's almost jarring how sllooowwwweeeeedddddd down they sound üê¢
[^4]: Heck, they've probably [taken a few pages](http://blog.supertop.co/post/161095313797/enhanced-audio "Supertop's blog post introducing Enhanced Audio") out of Overcast's!.
