![The \[TAG\] Heuer Monaco Caliber 11 (CAW211P)](file:///Users/Anthony/Desktop/CAW211P.JPG)

Growing up, I was just a *casual* wearer of watches. Sure, I had several Timex watches as a child. (Remember [Indiglo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiglo "Wikipedia entry for 'Indiglo'")?) But I certainly wasn't fascinated with things that go on my wrist. And of course, my most prominent memory of watch-wearing revolves around my grandpa. I remember he had a yellow gold quartz Seiko. It had a day and date complication.[^1]

Still, in the summer of 2014, I read a Gear Patrol article that inspired me to buy my first mechanical watch: a Seiko 5 (SNZF17). Even though the dial was slightly off center, I liked wearing the watch. Here was this little machine on my wrist, and it required very little care and feeding. In fact, it would have probably cost more send it in for service than to buy a brand new one to replace it.

Somewhat coincidentally, this Seiko 5 had day/date complications. Since I have a hard time remembering what day it is (or what date it is), those complications were practical. The Seiko 5 also provided some additional amount of function with the diver-inspired uni-directional bezel. But instead of timing my dives, I used the uni-directional bezel to time little things at work, such as how long to wait after anesthetizing before returning to a patient room to ðŸ˜·

I stopped wearing the Seiko 5 when the Apple Watch launched in 2015. As an Apple nerd, I couldn't resist the baby iPhone on my wrist. I could see the temperature, set a timer, andâ€”with an abnormal amount of wrist flickingâ€”I could check the time!

However, after wearing the Apple Watch for several months, the delay associated that aforementioned abnormal wrist flicking grew tiring. I wondered: would a `regular` watch be more my thing? On a whim, I switched back to my Seiko 5. By this time, I had read a few more articles on Hodinkee, enough for me to realize that while the Seiko 5 was a great value, it really wasn't anything special.

What else was there?

We'll come back to that in a second.

Around the spring of 2016, I got super into Porsche. I always planned on having a nice car "when I grew up." Well, last year, I accelerated that nebulous timeline such that I wanted to have my first 911 by the time I was 30. A somewhat arbitrary goal, I suppose, but I thought it was an achievable one.[^1]

Naturally, after having fallen *deep* into Porsche, I couldn't help but stumble upon their motorsport endeavors. Around this time, Patrick Dempsey (of Grey's Anatomy fame) was still reeling from his WEC/IMSA victories from the previous year. I thought that was so cool. Here's this [wealthy] movie-star guyâ€”a so-called "gentlemen driver"â€”who was rubbing shoulders on and off the track with *actual* professional drivers.

And what timepiece adorned his wrist? None other than TAG Heuer's Monaco Caliber 12 (CAW2111). I thought to myself, "This is a cool watch. It doesn't look like any Rolex I've ever seen, and *I don't know anyone else who wears one.*"

Indeed.

You see, without delving too deeply into the history of Heuer, TAG Heuer, and now TAG Heuer under LVMH, suffice it to say that the [TAG] Heuer's reissues and vintage-inspired timepieces aren't as ubiquitous as, say, a minty 16710. TAG Heuer of today is associated with 

[^1]: Interestingly, I'm hard-pressed to think of a watch whose dial is *not* made overly, well, complicated by having both a day and date complication. Less is more.
[^2]: Of course, there's certainly something to be said about living within one's means, and waiting until we're old and gray to start living. That is, after all, what so many well-off people do. (How do you think they got to be so well-off?) But I've always subscribed to the [opposite philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46GwJbrMghQ).
