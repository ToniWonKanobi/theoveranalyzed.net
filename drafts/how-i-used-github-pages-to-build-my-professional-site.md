A few days ago I [linked](/2016/1/3/my-second-website-anthony-craig-dds "My linked post to my professional website") to my professional site, <http://anthonycraigdds.com>.

Although the entire site only weights 461 KB, and although it is only as single "page" with a more-or-less centered layout, it took me a while to get up and running.

### GitHub Pages

As I eluded in its introductory post, [Camel](/tags/Camel) wasn't going to suit me for my dental website. I asked Casey Liss if he had any recommendations, and he pointed me to GitHub Pages---a service I knew nothing about before the conversation with Casey.

When I finally dove into GitHub Pages, it all went pretty smoothly.

The instructions provided by GitHub couldn't be any plainer:

1. Create an account on GitHub (if you don't already have one)
	
	(I'm [@toniwonkanobi](https://github.com/ToniWonKanobi "Me on GitHub") on GitHub.)
	
2. Create a new repository for the webpage you want to create

	(The repository for my professional website is located here: <https://github.com/ToniWonKanobi/anthonycraigdds>)
	
3. In this new repository, create a new branch (distinct from the `master` branch) called `gh-pages`

	(GitHub  also recommends setting the `gh-pages` branch as the default branch)

4. Create file called `index.html` (which would serve as the homepage for the site) and `commit` the change

After that, the project page is available at `http://username.github.io/repository`, or, for me: <http://toniwonkanobi.github.io/anthonycraigdds/>

Now, I don't know about you, but the `username.github.io` subdomain-y stuff wasn't really what I was going for with my dental website:

"Hello, potential patient I just recently met in a non-dental setting. Oh, you'd like some contact information? Sure, just head on over to 'toniwonkanobi.github.io.' Oh, you don't know how to spell that? Oh, okay. Oh, you think that's a super long and hard-to-remember URL? Oh, okay. Sure I know the addresses to several nearby dentists."

I purchased `anthonycraigdds.com` a while ago, and I always intended on using that domain for my dental website.

Hover has been my domain registrar for a while now, and although it's got great customer service, it's interface isn't the easiest-in-the-world to navigate.
