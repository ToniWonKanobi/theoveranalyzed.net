Vox recently ran a short [piece](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9223391/undercover-videos-meat-america) reviewing the conditions for [factory farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming)[^farmsanct] animals in America.

Towards the end of the video, the narrator asks, "Should the American public know how their food is made?"

My answer to that question comes swiftly and without question.

*Yes*.

But I thought for a good long while on the next question asked:

"And, once they do, will they accept it?"

That's harder for me to answer. And I believe that is at the heart of the Vox piece.

# YouTube Has Been Great for Animals

Want to learn about animal cruelty? Easy: YouTube. Google's $1B acquisition is chalk-full of unsettling undercover investigations recounting animal abuse on factory farms in America. Organizations like Mercy For Animals (MFA), the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and---to a lesser extent---the Humane Society of The United States (HSUS) do their best to splatter the internet with provocative "insider" videos.

And you know what? It works. 

Oftentimes, the videos depict outright egregious acts of evil directed towards animals. It is easy to watch those videos and immediately form a deep-seated hatred for those deplorable factory farm workers. But it's not just me who thinks so. Just look at the  comments section of any one of those videos. There you'll find *plenty* of non-vegans renouncing factory farm workers. 

That's because it doesn't take an outstanding level of sympathy and empathy to find conditions at factory farms to be horrible. Indeed, I imagine some of the most hardened people alive might be the *first* whose eyes well up upon realizing what factory farming does to animals.

# It's Not that People Don't Care

If the campaigns by MFA, PETA, and HSUS are so effective, why do factory farms still exist? Do people not care?

I don't think the problem is a want for caring people. The problem is that not enough people *know* what's really going on. Not enough people know where their meat is coming from.

Optimistically, I tend to believe that once people *truly* know the [implications of consuming animal products](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/campaigns/factory_farming/), they will no longer want to do so. 

However, pessimistically, I wonder
